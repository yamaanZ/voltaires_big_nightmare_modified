#Parias
 parias_events.1.t: "Christians demand Paria"
 parias_events.1.d: "During the second half of the eleventh century, the Christian kings of Iberia would demand parias, or tributes, from the rulers of the Muslim taifas. The kings of León demanded tribute from Toledo, Badajoz, Seville, Granada, and Valencia, while the Counts of Barcelona demanded tribute from Zaragoza, Lérida, and Tortosa. Paria is now demanded of you and you are faced with the choice: to pay or not to pay?"
 parias_events.1.a: "Pay a half-year's income in full."
 parias_events.1.b: "Pay only a quarter-year's income from the treasury, and tax the people for the rest."
 parias_events.1.c: "We shall not pay a tribute!"
 parias_events.tt.1: "This may incur a declaration of war."
 parias_events.2.t: "A Paria Challenged"
 parias_events.2.d: "The nation of [From.GetName], who has long paid us tribute, has just refused to do so, sending back our envoy rejected."
 parias_events.2.a: "To war we march!"
 parias_events.2.b: "Perhaps some diplomacy can settle this."
 parias_events.3.t: "The Christian Response"
 parias_events.3.d: "The nation of [From.GetName] has responded to our refusal to pay our paria by declaring war. May they perish in flames!"
 parias_events.3.a: "Fools!"
 parias_events.4.t: "The Christian Response"
 parias_events.4.d: "The nation of [From.GetName] has responded to our refusal to pay our paria. The heathen cowards decided to not declare war. May our people be free and glorious!"
 parias_events.4.a: "Fools!"
 parias_events.5.t: "Restoring a Paria"
 parias_events.5.d: "Our nation has declared a war to restore a paria from our enemies, who have recently decided to scorn [Root.GetName] by refusing to pay tribute. The paria will be restored upon our inevitable victory in the war."
 parias_events.5.a: "They shall grovel before our majesty!"
 parias_events.6.t: "Paria Restored"
 parias_events.6.d: "We have lost all. The Christians declared a most terrible war after we rightfully did not pay them their demanded paria, but we lost. Now, we must pay again. Truly this is a shameful day for our people."
 parias_events.6.a: "When will the next demand come?"
 parias_events.7.t: "Paria Restored"
 parias_events.7.d: "Glory! It is our ultimate victory over the heathens! They cannot in their folly think that our righteous majesty would not annihilate them in war! They will bleed their coffers into ours!"
 parias_events.7.a: "Victory!"
 parias_events.8.t: "Triumph In Paria War"
 parias_events.8.d: "We shall never pay again! The Christians can burn in their castles while we revel in the glory of our victory. Never again shall [Root.GetName] be so humiliated as to pay a paria!"
 parias_events.8.a: "To Glory!"
 parias_events.9.t: "Muslim Victory In Paria War"
 parias_events.9.d: "The sky falls on us and the tower's walls crumble. Dark clouds bring hellfire onto us. It is a day of misery, a day of mocking. We have failed Christendom in every way. The heathens have renounced our right to demand tribute from them and proved it on the battlefield. Iberia shall burn in the fires of hell!"
 parias_events.9.a: "Truly a sad day for Christendom."
 parias_events.10.t: "Paria Received"
 parias_events.10.d: "By the rightful majesty of our glorious nation, [From.GetName] has given us the tribute that the heathen scum can only but wish to pay. It is their disgusting salvation."
 parias_events.10.a: "Collect the Paria"
 parias_events.10.tt: "[From.GetName] will transfer §Y25.0%§! of their yearly income to us."
#Almoravids
 almoravids_events.1.t: "The Almoravid Invasion"
 almoravids_events.1.d: "Spurred on by strict orthodoxy and missionary zeal, the Almoravids have recently united the warring Berber tribes of Mauritania under [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. With the end of instability in the region and the pacification of the Sanhaja tribes, the Almoravids' gaze has quickly turned to the infidel Emirates of Morocco. Thanks to an alliance with the Atlas Berbers, a massive Almoravid army was now able to cross the Atlas Mountains. In no time at all, the Almoravids conquered the major cities of Southern Morocco, ousted their former rulers, and seized the land for themselves..."
 almoravids_events.1.a: "Inshallah!"
 almoravids_events.tt.1: "§MThe Almoravids will annex Southern Morocco.§!"
 almoravids_events.2.t: "An Envoy to the Almoravids"
 almoravids_events.2.d: "Recently, a proposition was made by your finest advisors to send an envoy to the Almoravid dynasty of Morocco, our Muslim brethren, to secure help in our disastrous war against the heathens."
 almoravids_events.2.a: "Better to Pasture Camels than to Herd Swine!"
 almoravids_events.2.b: "We shall prevail without assistance."
 almoravids_events.tt.2: "If the Almoravids accept, we shall get §G200§! ¤, §G20,000§! £icon_manpower£ and a truce with them."
 almoravids_events.3.t: "Request for Help"
 almoravids_events.3.d: "A hasty delegation from [From.GetName] has reached our court: [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] desperately asks us for support against the presumably superior forces of [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] Christian enemies. Shall we assist our brothers in faith by money and men?"
 almoravids_events.3.a: "Dispatch an auxiliary army"
 almoravids_events.3.b: "We can't spare anything"
 almoravids_events.4.t: "The Moroccan Response"
 almoravids_events.4.d: "The Almoravid dynasty of Morocco have received your envoy and have responded affirmatively. They shall provide twenty thousand of their finest warriors!"
 almoravids_events.4.a: "To Glory!"
 almoravids_events.5.t: "Almoravid Withdrawal"
 almoravids_events.5.d: "An envoy was sent to you by the Almoravids last night: [MOR.Monarch.GetTitle] [MOR.Monarch.GetName] of Morocco, citing issues in the Maghreb and the need to further consolidate [MOR.Monarch.GetHerHis] power base, as well as success in Iberia, has decided to withdraw the Almoravid force sent to your aid. A cursed day for the realm."
 almoravids_events.5.a: "Moroccan Scum!"
 almoravids_events.6.t: "Moroccan Prevention"
 almoravids_events.6.d: "Our diplomats report of a dwindling power of the Taifa kingdoms of Iberia, caused by lax military and spiritual activity of their rulers. On top of that, many Taifa rulers have lapsed into a decadent and wasteful lifestyle that they can only finance through unbearable taxes. In order to prevent them from being captured by the aspiring Christian kingdoms of the North, our advisors propose to conquer the Taifas beforehand."
 almoravids_events.6.a: "Let's spread righteousness, correct injustice and abolish unlawful taxes"
 almoravids_events.6.b: "We are not interested in Al-Andalus"
 almoravids_events.tt.6: "Annex Gibraltar and get claims in all provinces of Al-Andalus."
 almoravids_events.7.t: "Almoravid Invasion"
 almoravids_events.7.d: "They have set sail in the fleet of death and come across the sea. Gibraltar is lost! The Almoravids of Morocco, after helping Al-Andalus defeat the Christians, returned to their African dwellings. But yet here they are, and this time to fight us, not the infidels! Our people, angered by our religious illegitimacy and supposedly tyrannical rule, support the invaders. Doom!"
 almoravids_events.7.a: "Surrender all of our land!"
 almoravids_events.7.b: "We will fight!"
 almoravids_events.8.t: "Almoravid Invasion"
 almoravids_events.8.d: "We have been attacked! Our fellow Muslim brethren, the Almoravid dynasty of Morocco, have attacked us. Our people support them, claiming that we have no religious legitimacy and that they have been unjustly taxed. Doom has come!"
 almoravids_events.8.a: "Surrender all of our land!"
 almoravids_events.8.b: "We will fight!"
 almoravids_events.9.t: "Almoravid Invasion"
 almoravids_events.9.d: "The Almoravids of Morocco, after helping the Taifa rulers of Al-Andalus to defend against the Christians, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar with the aim of subjugating the Taifas before the Christians! Bloody and devastating times will come upon us."
 almoravids_events.9.a: "Disastrous!"
 almoravids_events.10.t: "Our Holy Mission"
 almoravids_events.10.d: "We have pledged to subjugate and convert the infidels of Mauritania in order to spread true Islam. Our close environment remains controlled by petty governors who do not recognize our authority and continue to practice their sinful religion."
 almoravids_events.10.a: "They will kneel in front of us!"
 almoravids_events.10.b: "It's not time yet"
#Mongols
 invasion_events.1.t: "Province Falls!"
 invasion_events.1.d: "The occupation of $PROVINCENAME$ by the hostile invaders $CONTROLLERNAME$ has taken quite a toll on the local population. All resistance has collapsed, and the province is effectively lost to their power."
 invasion_events.1.a: "We will reconquer it later"
 invasion_events.1.b: "Tell them to hold out"
 invasion_events.2.t: "Arrival of the Ilkhanate"
 invasion_events.2.d: "Following the ruthless execution of Mongol envoys and merchants by decree of Ala ad-Din Muhammad II of Khwarazm, Persia was wholly subjugated by the Mongol hordes within two years. With unmatched speed, the infamously brutal horsemen looted, razed, and downright leveled many Persian centers to the ground, leaving Persia a desolate wasteland in the aftermath.\nAfter subsequently destroying the seeds of rebellion planted throughout Persia and consolidating their rule, the Mongols have shifted their gaze further west, with their next target being Mesopotamia. A potential Mongol invasion, warn chroniclers and the superstitious alike, may reshape the political landscape of Mesopotamia for centuries to come."
 invasion_events.2.a: "It's the End of Days!"
 invasion_events.3.t: "Arrival of the Golden Horde"
 invasion_events.3.d: "Under the watchful command of Temüjin - more commonly known as the warmonger Genghis Khan - a divided Mongolia was united into a string of allied tribes. Notorious for having rapidly conquered swathes of territories in China and Central Asia in unison, they have already subdued the Tatars with relative ease. Greedy for more blood and treasure as always, the Mongols have began to venture further west, bringing any opposition down to grovel at the feet of their deadly horsemen.\nRumors of the merciless steppe warriors slaughtering entire cities in mere days has ignited flames of despair within the hearts of the populace; even the largest and most powerful armies of the empires of Europe stand no chance against the superior armies of the Mongols."
 invasion_events.4.t: "Safavids Arrive"
 invasion_events.4.d: "As internal disputes over the throne weakened the Timurid Empire in the 15th century, it became increasingly unable to take effective action. Seizing this opportunity, the armies of Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu launched attacks, successfully occupying significant portions of Persia. Amidst this tumultuous period, the militant Sufi order of Safawiyya emerged as a dominant force. Originating from Ardabil, they first conquered Azerbaijan and eventually extended their rule over all of Persia.\nThe leader of the Safawiyya order has recently assumed the title of Shahanshah of Persia and declared Shiite Islam as the official state religion of his Empire. It is evident that this zealous leader aspires not only to rule Persia but to extend his dominion far beyond its borders."
 invasion_events.4.a: "These are dark times"
 invasion_events.5.t: "Seljuks Arrive"
 invasion_events.5.d: "One of the Turkmen clans of the Oghuz tribe in Central Asia has led a powerful army into Persia and rapidly overthrown the local powers. These Turks are descended from a certain Seljuk who recently converted to Sunni Islam, and call themselves 'Ghazi' - warriors of the faith who will liberate the world from heathens and Shi'a heretics.\nThe Shiite Buyid branches in the east stood no chance against the might of these Seljuk Turks, and now they have turned their eyes toward Mesopotamia. They vow to ultimately fulfil the Prophet's last commandment on his deathbed - to destroy the Roman Empire and to occupy the holy city of Constantinople."
 invasion_events.6.t: "Timurids Arrive"
 invasion_events.6.d: "When Khan Abu Baghatur died without heir in 1335, the Ilkhanate shattered completely in the confusion of unclear succession, giving rise to small Persian, Turkic and Mongol rulers and governors. Shortly later, a dreaded general named 'Timur' ascended to the Sultan of Transoxania, leading his forceful with cunning and a hard hand against his impotent foes.\nWith the recent smashing of the small dynasties in Persia, Timur usurped the lost legacy of the Ilkhanate. However, the hunger for power of this cruel Sultan does not seem to be satisfied as messengers report the overwhelming invasion of Mesoptamia by Timur 'the Lame', willing to create a new order once again."
#Norman Invasions
 nrm_invasions.1.t: "[irish_invasion_tag.GetName] Requests our Support"
 nrm_invasions.1.d: "A crisis unfolding in [irish_invasion_tag.GetName] about who will succeed its ruler [irish_invasion_tag.Monarch.GetName] has prompted reactions from a number of opportunistic nearby states seeking to gain politically themselves. However, recently we have been approached by [irish_invasion_tag.Monarch.GetName] [irish_invasion_tag.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] to resolve the conflicts gripping [irish_invasion_tag.Monarch.GetHerHis] nation once and for all by defeating the potential claimants to their [irish_invasion_tag.GovernmentName].\n\nSensing an opportunity to revitalize their fortunes by campaigning in an island long considered by us to be a bastion of barbarism, Anglo-Norman mercenaries have flocked to our banners led by the talented Richard de Clare, nicknamed 'Strongbow'. We can send them over to [irish_invasion_tag.GetName] to uphold the legitimacy of the current ruler, but it is unclear as to whether this will be worth the effort in the long run."
 nrm_invasions.1.a: "They want support, so they shall have it."
 nrm_invasions.1.b: "We should stay out of their bewildering succession conflicts."
 nrm_invasions.2.t: "The Rise of Strongbow"
 nrm_invasions.2.da: "Upon the death of the previous ruler of [Root.GetName], unexpected circumstances have conspired to bring Richard 'Strongbow' de Clare, the very man sent to keep the [Root.GovernmentName] out of foreign hands, to assume rulership of it in its entirety. His declaration to be [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] has been met with a mixed response both from within and afar, but he has claimed divine justification for doing so: a papal bull issued by the Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] known as Laudabiliter, supposedly authorizing him to take control of Ireland in the name of the [ENG.Monarch.GetTitle] of [ENG.GetName].\nFaced with such irrefutable evidence of his legitimacy, it seems we have no choice but to embrace this situation, especially now that the other claimants have been forced out."

 nrm_invasions.3.d: "In recent years, bands of Normans arriving from England and Wales have been terrorizing the Irish countryside and causing upheavals left and right. This has not gone unnoticed by us yet we evidently have never thought ourselves vulnerable to this new threat - until now.\nA Norman mercenary known as [Root.norman_invasion_heir.GetName] has abruptly led his troops across our borders and sent a message to our court, demanding that we submit and install him as our new ruler, or face the destruction of our territory!\nThe decision is now ours: do we stand and fight to preserve our independence, or humbly submit to avoid further reprisals?"
 nrm_invasions.3.a.tt: "§Y[Root.norman_invasion_heir.GetName]§! becomes our new Ruler."

 nrm_invasions.4.a: "Our [Root.GovernmentName] is no more!"
 nrm_invasions.5.t: "Annexation of The Pale"
 nrm_invasions.5.d: "Our monarchs have always coveted a foothold on Ireland in order to launch further invasions, in the hope of uniting the island under [ENG.GetAdjectiveCap] rule. Yet the Norman lords we sent to consolidate control over Ireland have been allowed to act with much greater independence than at home, to the point where they are de facto separate from the rest of the [Root.GovernmentName].\nTo remedy this, one of our advisors has suggested acquiring the valuable city of Dublin from [pale_owner_country.GetName] to use as a base for exerting further control over the de jure Lordship of Ireland. The proposal seems tempting and our loyal lords in the region will no doubt be pleased to see the order restored and power consolidated."
 nrm_invasions.5.a: "Let us secure a foothold in Ireland"
 nrm_invasions.5.b: "Leave the Irish to govern themselves"
 nrm_invasions.6.t: "The Statutes of Kilkenny"
 nrm_invasions.6.d: "For some time now the reality of the Norman 'invasion' of Ireland has sunk in, and the results are less than satisfactory. While we expected the Irish to fully embrace our own culture and customs, we did not expect the Norman conquerors to be even more Irish still, having forsaken the English ways almost completely. Some have even gone so far as to actively seek alliances and marriages with the remaining Irish clans for their own protection.\nAuthored principally by the Duke of Clarence, the Statutes of Kilkenny are sweeping in their efforts at curbing the Irish influence on the English settlers. They forbid intermarriage between English and Irish and the use of Irish language, customs, names or dress. Most importantly, however, they replace the old Irish Brehon law with English common law to govern the English in Ireland, and separate the Irish and English churches."
 nrm_invasions.6.a: "Sign the Statutes into law immediately!"
 nrm_invasions.6.a.tt: "Every country with §YHiberno-Norman§! primary culture and a capital in the §YIreland§! superregion gets the '§YKilkenny Statutes§!' modifier until the end of the game."

 nrm_invasions.7.t: "The Statutes of Kilkenny"
 nrm_invasions.7.d: "We have received word from a [From.GetAdjectiveCap] delegation that the Statutes of Kilkenny have been signed into law by the Parliament of Ireland. These forbid intermarriage between English and Irish and the use of Irish language, customs, names or dress. Most importantly, however, they replace the old Irish Brehon law with English common law to govern the English in Ireland, and separate the Irish and English churches.\nRegardless of whether these new laws are best for our people and our ruling class, who have become indistinguishable from the Irish themselves, we must accept them for the time being."
 nrm_invasions.7.a: "We will have to contend with this."
 nrm_invasions.9.t: "Anarchy in [From.GetName]"
 nrm_invasions.9.d: "An ongoing succession dispute in [From.GetName] has become too much to bear for the surrounding Kingdoms, and they have demanded that [Root.GetName] in its ruling capacity as High King of Ireland step in and put an end to the disorder that has plagued the region.\nNo matter how costly this venture is, we would lose all legitimacy if we did not heed their demands. If a High King cannot maintain order, what kind of High King is he?"
 nrm_invasions.9.a: "Heavy is the head..."
#Western Schism
 western_schism.1.t: "A Gift for the Pope"
 western_schism.1.d: "The most gracious Holy Father, King of Kings, vicar of Christ on Earth, was given all of Western Europe in fief by that great Emperor of Rome, Constantine. We should make a move to recognize the legitimacy of this donation by directly turning over some of our lands to the Papacy, to be integrated into their temporal domain. The city of Avignon seems like a good choice, as it has a fortified palace that the Popes could use as a residence when visiting France."
 western_schism.1.a: "Donate Avignon!"
 western_schism.1.b: "We can't afford it"
 western_schism.2.t: "A Gift From [From.GetName]"
 western_schism.2.d: "The wise ruler of [From.GetName], recognizing our temporal rights over Europe, has seen fit to donate the city of Avignon to our holy patrimony. We must send an apostolic legate immediately to bring it in line with our administrative standards, and make preparations for a grand Pontifical entrance."
 western_schism.2.a: "Deus Vult"
 western_schism.3.t: "The Babylonian Captivity"
 western_schism.3.d: "As rightful rulers of France, we exert considerable influence over the Papacy due to their presence in Avignon. The local fortress has even been converted into another Papal estate - the Palais des Papes. We could tighten our stranglehold over Papal affairs if we simply strongarmed the Popes into compliance, confining them to Avignon and turning it into a new Vatican.\nThe global reaction from other Catholic states would be dire, but we could effectively turn the universal church into another branch of French governmental interests. With that kind of power, any opposition could be stamped out over time. Do we dare risk the reputational fallout of this bold gambit?"
 western_schism.3.a: "Unlimited power!"
 western_schism.3.tt: "§MThe Papacy will be forced to move their capital to Avignon§!"
 western_schism.3.b: "Execute whoever suggested it"
 western_schism.4.t: "A Captive Papacy"
 western_schism.4.d: "It seems the 'magnanimous' gift of Avignon was simply a fraud of the scheming Frenchmen to increase their influence over our affairs! They have now forced [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to abandon the Vatican and move to Avignon, where [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is essentially under house arrest. The Holy, Universal, Catholic Church has been trodden under by the dogs, just as when the demonic Theophylacti of Tusculum used our supreme vicarate for their debaucheries during the Saeculum Obscurum. Hopefully our new French overlords will not sink to the level of the final Tusculan Pope, Benedictus IX, who became pope at age 20, served three separate terms, and was the only man to have sold the Papacy for a cash payout. \n\nO beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves!"
 western_schism.4.a: "Woe!"
 western_schism.5.t: "A Second Great Schism"
 western_schism.5.d: "Few thought something as devastating as the 1054 schism between the Western and Eastern churches could happen again, but that may just well occur due to our usurpation of Papal power. The latest Pope insists that he should return to Italy to govern the Church from its ancient seat, and will listen to none of our protests or threats.\nWe could simply call it a loss and let the Holy Father escape from our grasp, or we could challenge the legitimacy of his election in the first place, supplying our own candidate. This tactic was used extensively by the early Holy Roman Emperors in their own conflicts with the church, propping up so-called 'antipopes' with limited recognition. The virtuous and preeminent reputation of our state, of course, ensures many more Catholics will flock to our side if we denounce the current Pope as illegitimate."
 western_schism.5.a: "We'll elect our own Pope"

 western_schism.7.t: "Captivity Unrecognized"
 western_schism.7.d: "With the rise of popular theological movements across Europe, our continued claims over the Papacy are seen transparently by the citizenry of Europe, and no longer carry any clout. The Papacy has escaped from our grasp despite all our efforts."

 italian_monarchy_events.1.d: "The current power of the Communia has understandably caused unrest and opposition amongst the more monarchist-minded citizens of the Commune.

 italian_monarchy_events.3.d: "The politics of Italian Communes were just as much locked between monarchists (Signoria) and republicans (Communia) as between Guelphs and Ghibellines. Despite the Ghibelline alignment with the Empire, there was little rhyme or reason to which faction matched which political philosophy. Most city-states were stuck in an endless cycle of republican revolutions and strongmen founding brief dynastic states.\n\nA festival this month has given us the opportunity to raise public support for our political agenda.

 italian_monarchy_events.4.a: "Free money"
 italian_monarchy_events.4.b: "It's in the name"
 italian_monarchy_events.5.t: "Conspiracy in the Commune"
 italian_monarchy_events.5.d: "It has come to the attention of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that one of our best generals is involved with a plot to overthrow the ruling family and install himself as leader. Such machinations were common in Italian city-states amongst the class of higher nobles and official 'protectors', and would often spell a long-term change in dynastic fortunes. Since we have discovered this plot, we can exile the general from our city, but we will obviously lose his talents if we do so."
 italian_monarchy_events.5.a: "Exile him"
 italian_monarchy_events.5.b: "We can hold out"

 italian_monarchy_events.6.d: "One of the preeminent artists of our Commune has created a beautiful set of frescos and paintings for a local church. So beautiful, in fact, that it would embellish our administrative palace with its presence. The ruling family is quite enamored with the artist's work, but appropriating it from the church would certainly ruffle feathers around the Commune.\nIt was precisely this action for which Cicero famously prosecuted Gaius Verres in 70 BC.

 eastern_monarchy_events.1.d: "Byzantine rulers had to rely more on the cooperation of ad-hoc landowners ruling from manor houses than on something resembling an organized feudal system. It was almost as if the lands of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] were tributaries under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], though without any officially held titles. If the doux of a certain area was uncooperative, those tax revenues were simply lost, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would often have to militarily remind the doux of their obligations."

In the old Roman Empire, the government attempted to assuage this issue by fixing bread prices and subsidizing bread rations to affected populations.\nIn the last harvest a famine has stricken one of our provinces, causing widespread unrest among the peasantry, and the local doux is unable to handle things. Should we attempt to use that ancient Roman solution?"

 eastern_monarchy_events.4.t: "An Ambitious General"
 eastern_monarchy_events.4.d: "In the Byzantine Empire, hereditary rule was sometimes weak and the whole concept of a 'dynasty' was muddied by adoptive members. Rather than sons succeeding fathers, powerful generals would force the ruling [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to recognize them as an heir or just overthrow the government entirely at the head of their army.\nOur court spies have reported rumors that one of our top commanders is planning to do just that, citing the weakness of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Clearly we must not allow this to happen - it was the scheming general Phokas in 602 that slew the great Emperor Maurice and ruined the primacy of Christendom in the face of its heathen rivals!"

 eastern_monarchy_events.5.t: "Doux Requests Privileges"
 eastern_monarchy_events.5.d: "Being the successors to the Roman villa system, we rely on the confidence and cooperation of a murky class of non-hereditary lords throughout the countrysides. One particular doux has approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] requesting special rights and allowances, so that he may strengthen his family's hold in that particular region.\n\nTo grant his request would certainly anger the other powerful families in our state, but would ensure the loyalty of that area for the time being."

If we melt down these precious metals, it will greatly boost the royal coffers and minting programs, which have been sadly debased over the centuries from the glory days of the Solidus or Bezant."

 turkish_government_events.1.t: "Former Lala Seeks Appointment"
 turkish_government_events.1.d: "Our former Lala, a trusted man who mentored us in our childhood, has come humbly requesting a position in the royal court. He offers his services at a discount, but it may give the wrong impression if we bow to his request - some may take it as favoritism or at best sentimentality.\n\nHow should we treat the Lala's plea?"

 turkish_government_events.1.b: "Pay him a stipend and send him away"
 turkish_government_events.2.t: "Court Divided"
 turkish_government_events.2.d: "The peace viziers and war viziers are bitterly divided over what direction we should steer the state in. As usual, the pacifists urge us to focus on internal stability, reining in the many ethno-religious groups of our empire and ironing out problems with our administrative systems. The militarists denounce this as cowardice, and demand we focus on conquest, starting with rigorous training of our standing army."

 turkish_government_events.4.d: "A Sufi preacher has riled up some of the pastoral tribesmen with calls to jihad. The Sufis usually are content to live peaceful lives of mystical dhikr, but every once in a while someone like this man comes along - and the historical result has usually been a bloody revolution that overthrows the state.\n\nHow should we proceed? It may be dangerous to make the Sufi a martyr."

 turkish_government_events.4.b: "Execute him!"
 turkish_government_events.5.t: "Conscription Issues"
 turkish_government_events.5.d: "The war viziers complain that we could be more efficient in recruiting soldiers from our urban populations. Like Knights of the Christian West, richer soldiers can be assigned command positions and bring their own high-quality armor and weapons to the battlefield with them. It could be a great advantage to have such burgher-warriors fighting alongside more traditional tribal horsemen and professional janissaries."

 turkish_government_events.6.d: "Our war and peace viziers seem to be able to agree on only one thing - that the time for fence-sitting has passed. They demand that we make clear the direction in which we plan to take our growing empire, as we cannot focus on everything at once. Ultimately, cuts will have to be made somewhere."

 turkish_government_events.7.d: "It has been brought to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s attention that certain viziers in the court are involved in corrupt dealings - blackmail, shakedowns, slush funds, favors, and other such criminal acts. The Lalas, loyal to each [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] from birth, are perhaps the only group we can trust within the stately apparatus.\n\nShould we task the Lalas with the duty of rooting out these corrupt officials?"

 turkish_government_events.7.b: "Shakedown is a dance, correct?"
 turkish_government_events.8.t: "Viziers Oppose War"
 turkish_government_events.8.d: "Our ongoing war has caused much dismay among the court's viziers, who favor a more peaceful path for [Root.GetName]. The cost of the whole conflict has been quite taxing on a state coffers and local populations, and one particular vizier's call for peace is gaining increasing momentum within the capital. On the other hand, there are rumors that the pacifists' opponents are plotting to murder this vizier on the grounds of cowardice and treason. If we listen to the vizier's advice, those same judgments may reflect on us too."

#Swiss Cantons
 canton_events.1.t: "Swiss Merchant Dies"
 canton_events.1.d: "One of the Canton's richest merchants has died, leaving no legal heirs. We can repossess his lands and fortunes for the state, or allow them to be divided between the many dubious claimants that have come out of the woodwork.\nThe latter path, while counterintuitive, could help bolster the fortunes of our Canton's other merchants, ultimately increasing our trade and tax revenues."

 canton_events.1.b: "Seize his property"
 canton_events.2.t: "Canton Attracts Speculators"
 canton_events.2.d: "The success of our Canton has piqued the interest of wise merchants from around the German region. A wave of immigrants have moved to the capital, bringing new industries and innovations with them. The local government can, however, intervene, and attempt to dictate exactly where these merchants are settled."

 canton_events.3.t: "For Switzerland!"
 canton_events.3.d: "As a canton, our state is tied to a Swiss identity. All our citizens are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom - and our late war may demand just that. Peasants and urban workers alike flock to local commanders offering to join the war effort."
 canton_events.3.a: "In per tuts!"
 canton_events.4.t: "War College?"
 canton_events.4.d: "The Swiss experiment with republicanism is unique within Europe. We can adorn our capital with a new war college, increasing both the city's prestige and its military capabilities. Some members of the Canton's ruling council, however, propose that we use our resources to instead strengthen our general infrastructure, which is especially important in a mountainous area."

 canton_events.5.d: "The tomb of a local saint who died centuries ago in the early Carolingian period was recently discovered after being thought lost. His miraculous relics, such as an uncorrupted limb and holy dust, have been presented to the Canton's elders to much excitement from the citizenry.\n\nWe are left with the question of what to do with them. They could well serve to ease tensions with another Canton."
 canton_events.5.a: "Send them to a neighbor"
 canton_events.5.b: "Keep them"
 canton_events.6.t: "A Gift Arrives"
 canton_events.6.d: "Our fellow Canton of [From.GetName], in the interest of Swiss unity and out of respect for our obviously preeminent state, has sent a special gift to us - the relics of an ancient Swiss saint thought lost for centuries.\nThe clerics of our largest basilica have already made space to install the relics, and surely they will attract swathes of pilgrims to boost the local economy - I mean nurture the spiritual health of our realm."

#Abbacies
 abbacy_events.1.t: "Communal Outreach"
 abbacy_events.1.d: "Monastic life is often based around isolation, with some traditions even advocating the complete separation of brothers or sisters aside from specific meeting times. A prior has approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a proposal for more outreach, though it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide where these attentions should be directed.\n\nThe monastic charter demands attention to other suffragan or parent houses, except in cases of severe sickness; but there is also an implicit obligation to attract righteous followers to become new monks or lay-servants."

 abbacy_events.1.b: "Local"
 abbacy_events.1.c: "We are better off alone!"

 abbacy_events.2.d: "The child of a local noble has come to our gates asking for entry into the monastic life. A host of other potential monks have joined [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] journey, and they carry a significant endowment for the support of the monastery.\n\nHow can we put them to use?"

 abbacy_events.3.d: "One of our members has lapsed into sin! It was discovered that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has been derelict in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] duties of prayer and labor, and may have even been cavorting with the local masses!\n\nWhat should be done about this outrageous breach of our monastic code?"

 abbacy_events.3.b: "Expel the weakling!"
 abbacy_events.3.c: "Penance and rehabilitation"
 abbacy_events.4.t: "Reforming Our Charter"
 abbacy_events.4.d: "A set of rules is the fundamental basis of life in an Abbey or Priory. Over time, however, these rules can become obsolete or neglected, prompting a series of reforms.\nIt is time that our monastery engaged in such a reformation - but we must choose which tradition to orient ourselves toward. Some favor the Cluniac model, while others find the Cistercian and Benedictine models more fitting to apostolic poverty."
 abbacy_events.4.a: "A Cluniac charter"
 abbacy_events.4.b: "A Cistercian charter"
 abbacy_events.4.c: "A Benedictine charter"
 abbacy_events.5.t: "Local Noble Seeks Blessing"
 abbacy_events.5.d: "In many cases, Abbacies were founded by a local noble who wanted to atone for their sins on the battlefield and in their daily life. Rich donations would allow for a community dedicated specifically to prayer for that individual's salvation - penitence by proxy. It was this practice that led to the foundation of Cluny by the Duke Guillaume of Aquitaine in AD 910.\nA powerful figure in the surrounding area has come to us requesting our help in that regard, and promises our role will not be forgotten."
 abbacy_events.5.a: "We shall pray"
 abbacy_events.6.t: "A New Abbey?"
 abbacy_events.6.d: "When one abbey gets too crowded for its own good, trusted monks will leave to found a new one, nominally subservient to the original. This is how Bernard's original abbey at Citeaux became a continent-spanning network of Cistercians - he had left his original home Molesme Abbey for its perceived vices.\nThough they do not complain of vices, some of our monks think it is time they established one such suffragan abbacy in the nearby woods."
 abbacy_events.6.a: "Go forth"
 abbacy_events.7.t: "Vows of Stability"
 abbacy_events.7.d: "Benedictine friars were required to take a vow of stability to ensure the Order's safety from decline. This anchored them to a specific foundation, but allowed them to wander the lands as a mendicant, preaching the good word and interacting with people from diverse backgrounds.\nMost recently, one of our mendicants has returned with a novel idea on how to increase our efficiency around the abbey."
 abbacy_events.7.a: "Wonderful"
 abbacy_events.8.t: "Finances Squandered"
 abbacy_events.8.d: "Those of a more Cluniac character contend that in our obsession with Apostolic poverty, our monastery is squandering its finances and potential. The monks already leave in cold, bare chambers, and if some improvements aren't made to the monastic grounds, these monks demand in inquisition from our parent house. One cannot help the poor or live a holy life if one is unable to move from sickness!"
 abbacy_events.8.a: "Give in"
 abbacy_events.8.b: "Worldly fools!"
 abbacy_events.9.t: "Purists Threaten to Leave"
 abbacy_events.9.d: "The ultimate ideal of Apostolic poverty is being ignored, argue some of our monks with Cistercian sympathies. They have issued an ultimatum - reform our abbacy, or they will leave en masse to found their own! Clearly they fancy themselves latter-day successors to Bernard of Clairvaux."
 abbacy_events.9.a: "Accommodate them"
 abbacy_events.9.b: "We don't need them!"
 abbacy_events.10.t: "Apostolic Duties Ignored"
 abbacy_events.10.d: "Those of a more Benedictine character in our abbacy think the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is lapsing into laziness. Meetings in the chapter house are not occurring on time, periods of silence are being ignored, and mistakes have even crept into the practice of Mass. What should be done about these Benedictine objections?"
 abbacy_events.10.a: "Pray for forgiveness"
 abbacy_events.10.b: "Who cares?"
#Roman Factions
 pap_faction_events.1.t: "The Power Behind the Throne"
 pap_faction_events.1.d: "Throughout the middle ages, the Papacy traded hands between the influence of corrupt Roman families like the Orsini and Colonna. The Colonna usually installed their own scions as Cardinals, leading to the Papal Conclave sometimes being occupied by men only in their twenties. The Orsini were more amenable to controlling Popes via blackmail and powerful Orsini mistresses who could bend the Papacy to the family's whims.\nThe recent 'election' of Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName] was of course engineered by these shadow-rulers and marks their real control of the Holy See."
 pap_faction_events.1.a: "We shall obey the Orsini"
 pap_faction_events.1.b: "We shall obey the Colonna"
 pap_faction_events.2.t: "The Roman Mob"
 pap_faction_events.2.d: "The Roman Mob has been an institution within the Papal State since the time of the Byzantine Duchy of Rome. The fickle masses are quick to agitate, and quick to turn against a Pope or Consul who they see as a threat to their interests. The current Pope, having been elected through the interference of corrupt Roman elites, is seen as illegitimate and now that the Mob has sidelined the Orsini and Colonna they have marched on the Lateran Palace to drag His Holiness through the streets!"
 pap_faction_events.2.a: "As the mob wishes"
 pap_faction_events.2.b: "Send in the militia"
 pap_faction_events.3.t: "Civic Defense"
 pap_faction_events.3.d: "The Roman Mob is outraged by the occupation of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and is preparing a general insurrection throughout the city. Key gates will be opened at night to let our troops regain control, and stealthy citizens with makeshift weapons are preparing to murder the guards that would otherwise keep the foreign garrison alerted.\nThe Mob is merely waiting for the word from His Holiness to put their plan into action and free [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] from the barbarians who have been harassing the populace and degrading the honor of the Holy See."
 pap_faction_events.3.a: "Go ahead!"
 pap_faction_events.3.b: "Tell them to be patient"
 pap_faction_events.4.t: "Clash With [papal_antagonist.GetName]"
 pap_faction_events.4.d: "It is well known that foreign powers meddle in Papal affairs and work to install local Popes loyal to their interests. The Roman nobility in turn often cooperate with these foreign rulers to exert joint control over the Holy Father, but sometimes these cooperative agreements break down and clashes break out. One such controversy has just emerged after a recent visit by representatives from [papal_antagonist.GetName], as the strings of [Root.Monarch.GetName] are being pulled in opposite directions. Things could get ugly if we do not make a decision regarding how to navigate this quagmire."

 pap_faction_events.4.b: "Side with the Roman Nobility"
 pap_faction_events.5.t: "Scandal Brewing"
 pap_faction_events.5.d: "The repeated abuses of Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName], a worldly puppet of the Roman elites, are becoming hard to ignore. Between the simony, the political double-dealing, the impious liaisons frequently known to occur... the Roman Mob has grown incensed by this corruption of the Vicarate of Christ and of the true Catholic faith. They are now demanding that we appoint a Cardinal to examine the state of the Holy See and root out corruption with a sweeping mandate, independent of the malign influence exerted by the Colonna and Orsini."
 pap_faction_events.5.a: "Hold an inquiry"
 pap_faction_events.5.b: "Cover it up!"
 pap_faction_events.6.t: "Unthinkable Simony"
 pap_faction_events.6.d: "The conniving Orsini, annoyed by the presence of a Colonna loyalist on the Chair of Saint Peter, have taken to undermining his power by exposing some of his gravest wrongdoings publicly before the Roman Mob! The hypocrisy of their whistleblowing when they themselves conduct all manner of corrupt and scandalous plots behind closed doors is outrageous. It has been revealed that Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName] was making overtures for a form of Simony hereto thought unthinkable - the sale of the Papacy itself. It is said that he was going to resign his Papal title and bestow it to the highest bidder in the city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]! Not since the Crisis of the Third Century has [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] known such a vile and corrupt betrayal of the principles of rule.\nWith the plot exposed, the Roman Mob has seized the unfortunate bidder and held a mock coronation with tar, confiscating all of the money he was going to pay for the public weal."
 pap_faction_events.6.a: "Disaster!"
 pap_faction_events.7.t: "A Papal Mistress"
 pap_faction_events.7.d: "The Orsini have frequently swayed the occupants of the Holy See by supplying them with mistresses from their family. However, now that the Colonna have taken power in the Papal State, they have publicly humiliated the last Orsini Pope by exposing his violations of the highest principle of clerical celibacy. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reputation may never recover from this disaster, and the Roman Mob have already spread jeers and satirical songs throughout [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. The Holy Father's mistress was chased out of the Lateran Palace and forced into exile at one of the Orsini's fortified family estates in Umbria.\nHow dare the Colonna presume to expose this iniquity when they themselves are guilty of crimes far worse!"
 pap_faction_events.7.a: "Nothing can be done"
 pap_faction_events.8.t: "A Friend of the Colonna"
 pap_faction_events.8.d: "As unscrupulous and corrupt as they are, the Colonna are certainly effective at expanding the influence of the Papal State and navigating the world of diplomacy. The wedding of a Colonna heiress with an important magnate from [colonna_friend.GetName] has brought us a great opportunity to foster friendly relations between our states and ensure the [colonna_friend.Monarch.GetTitle]s of [colonna_friend.GetName] remain friends of the Holy See.\nThe current Patricius of the Colonna has approached Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName] asking for him to personally officiate the wedding at their villa in Tusculum this month. It would be unwise to refuse his request."
 pap_faction_events.8.a: "Bless the wedding"
 pap_faction_events.8.b: "We do not need their talents!"
 pap_faction_events.9.t: "Orsini Cardinals"
 pap_faction_events.9.d: "The Orsini have proven themselves to be deft administrators since the time of Pope Celestine III. By filling our administration with Orsini partisans, we can surely streamline the affairs of the Holy See and keep the local powerbrokers across [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] in our good graces. Of course if we do so, we run the risk of alienating the Colonna, who are always looking for a chance to get a leg-up against their eternal rivals."
 pap_faction_events.9.a: "Appoint them"
 pap_faction_events.9.b: "We do not need their talents!"
 pap_faction_events.10.t: "Pax Romana"
 pap_faction_events.10.d: "For over two centuries the See of Saint Peter has been under the thumb of thuggish and reprobate Roman aristocrats. At last, this era of rivalry is coming to an end as more enlightened ideas take root in the Lateran Palace and maverick Cardinals work to definitively rid the Holy See of corruption. The various branches of the Orsini have been forced to stand down, while the home base of the Colonna in Palestrina has been reduced to ruin. At the head of these grand reforms is a Papal Bull called Pax Romana, which unilaterally reconciles the two families and ensures the Conclave of Cardinals will remain unbeholden to any outside powers."

 sufi_order_events.1.d: "Part of the duties of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in guiding the Ummah within [Root.GetName] is the maintenance and establishment of madrasas to teach the next generation of scholars. The heterodox leanings of our theocratic state, however, are often a source of criticism from more traditionalist scholars. With our next madrasa, we must decide whether to support Sufi-aligned esoteric schools of thought or more safe and widely-recognized forms of practice and jurisprudence."

 sufi_order_events.2.d: "It is an ongoing struggle for a state like ours to combat accusations of apostasy from strict legalists, who are highly distrustful of esoteric, Ghulat, and Sufi-aligned practices which are integral to our government. Several neighboring states have had their best jurists prepare a denunciation of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the forms of Islamic observance [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] permits.\nWe can perhaps combat these accusations if we commission a respected scholar to comprehensively rebut them and explain how all supposedly 'Sufi' or heterodox beliefs we profess are actually justified by Quran and Hadith. This will be no cheap undertaking, however."

Divided into two parts, the sermon first emphasizes the superiority of the Grace found in the New Testament over the Law of the Old Testament. Hilarion draws parallels between Isaac and the followers of Christianity, and Ishmael and the Jews, highlighting the chronological progression from the Law to Grace.

 elections.724.d: "The conflicted interests of the Holy Roman Emperors and the Popes has shattered Italian politics into competing factions - the imperial Ghibellines, so named for a certain fortress which was once a local power center, and the religious Guelphs, named for the Welf dynasty. Even long after the Popes and Emperors resolved their differences and open warfare died down throughout the Italian peninsula, the cultural division would remain, forcing ambitious states to side with one set of interests or the other. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must choose which faction to cast [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lot with, and beware the consequences of the inevitably angered opposing faction."

 hre_event.4.d: "For years now Imperial Authority over the Kingdom of Italy has been waning. Successive Emperors have failed to impose their will on the Italian states and large areas that are formally part of the Empire have been lost to republics and theocracies who reject the Empire's right to them.\nUnless Italy is firmly brought back into the Empire the states there may slip out of Imperial control forever."
 hre_event.4.a.tt: "Unless the number of Ghibelline rulers is greater than or equal to the number of Guelph rulers from 1490 until 1550 the states there are likely to leave the Empire. Passing Imperial Reforms and improving the Emperor's opinion with states will make them more likely to side with the Ghibellines."

Our great reliance on foreign, even uncivilized, people in our armies and administration is putting the Unity of our dynasty in question.\nUnless we take measures to become a truly Russian Principality we will remain Grand in name only and will appear to have lost our Unity."

 empire_of_china_in_name.2.d: "Our efforts to integrate the Russians in the state that rules them have born fruit and our claim to Unity is no longer in question due to lacking ties to the people themselves.

 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9104: "The Hundred Years War was the last great medieval war. It was a war not just between kings, but lesser nobles were also able to pursue their own personal agendas while participating in the larger conflict. Future wars saw far less factionalism, at least on the scale found in medieval conflicts. The Hundred Years War was actually dozens of little wars and hundreds of battles and sieges that went on for over a century, between 1337 and 1453, until both sides were exhausted. While neither side won in any real sense, the end result was that while there were two kingdoms at the beginning of the war, there were two nations at the end of it."
 EVTDESC5083: "During the period 1050-1600, Italian siege engineers were highly sought after to teach the ways of the trace Italienne to the militaries of Europe. In most cases, these engineers had no national identity and simply worked for whoever could afford to pay them."

The pirates of the Maghreb have become so emboldened by the absence of civilized government in the region that they have overrun the fort and proclaimed a Republic of Pirates.\n\nChief among them is the pirate captain Hayreddin Barbarossa, born Khidr Yakupoglu. Barbarossa maintains a tenuous leadership over the traitors and criminals of the city; the ruthless lieutenants under his command watch him closely for signs of weakness.\n\nThis 'Republic of Pirates' is not only a violation of our sovereignty over the Maghreb, but an affront to all civilized peoples.

These privateers have made their home in the town of [2697.GetName] on Gotland, where they have found great opportunity for plunder.\n\nThe willingness of Gotland's authorities to deal in stolen goods has also attracted a less savory sort; pirates who bear no letter of marque and recognize no sovereign have begun to make their bases on the island. The appeals of lawlessness have not been lost on our privateers; several have already abandoned their commissions and turned pirates. The gossip in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is that Gotland has become a pirate utopia, a Sodom of the Baltic Sea."

 pirates.7.d: "After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the arduous pacification of the kingdom began when numerous Earls tried to regain power. Meanwhile, a small group of Earls left England to avoid subjugation and sailed to the Black Sea coast, where they were promised land by the Byzantine Emperor.\n\nWithout our consent, they landed on our coast, where, due to their superior equipment, they took over part of our territory. There they have begun to build their own Anglo-Saxon cities and live out their strange culture and religion."

Strangely enough, they have not attacked a single one of our merchant ships; Venetian ships are their most common prey.\n\nTherefore, our advisors are divided on how to deal with these corsairs.

 pirates.20.d: "The constant clashes between and within England and France have created a dangerous environment in the English Channel. Whereas in the past merchants and other civilian vessels could safely pass through the strait, nowadays pirates and privateers, usually hired by either English or French lords, roam the sea.\nA former monk who studied black magic in Spain in his youth, has lived as a bandit for a long time after being robbed of his murdered father's possessions. Spurred on by his grudge against feudal lords and supported by the local pirates, he recently took the unguarded islands of the English Channel with his gang.\nIt is certain that this notorious man will further worsen the situation in the English Channel for righteous people."
 pirates.21.t: "Return to Cilician Piracy?"
 pirates.21.d: "Triggered by the decline of the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BC, Cilicia developed into a stronghold for well-organized piracy. Over time, the pirates established bases as far away as Gibraltar and had more than 1000 ships specialized in conquest, plunder and boarding. According to Plutarch, even Caesar was captured by the Cilician pirates on a voyage to Rhodes. Only a massive fleet of Romans under Pompey was able to destroy the pirates in 67 BC.\nWith the decline of the Byzantine Empire, we find ourselves in a similar situation. We could take the nearly insane step of raising the black flag on our ships, reviving our ancient heritage."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head towards her, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes meet and [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows she has seen something unusual, but good, nevertheless. With piety in her gaze, she whispers how she has seen the biggest catfish ever, a true incarnation of the spirit of the river we so deeply worship. [Root.Monarch.GetName] follows her to the spot where she saw it and after a few breaths [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally sees it. It is huge indeed.

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spear and quietly moves closer to it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] leaves the row over [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] canoe, stand up and have the spear ready to be fired. The beaver emerges, their gazes contact as [Root.Monarch.GetName] releases the weapon."
 native_americans.29.d4: "The hunting group is coming back home when among the group of mountain goats that comes across [Root.Monarch.GetName], the biggest goat [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has ever seen appears. Almost as if it was a deity, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can feel a special bright aura around it and immediately knows [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] have to hunt it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] leaves the group behind and move silently to sneak the animal. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is ready, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, hoping to not miss the chance."
 native_americans.29.d5: "The land trembles as [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets closer to the herd of wisents. These animals can kill anyone with their gore attacks with ease, but they are also life for our people. Suddenly, among them, [Root.Monarch.GetName] can see a massive male that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows has to be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] prey. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] for this unequal fight before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors with a quick pray.

 native_americans.36.d: "The last hunt was very good and we managed to gather a lot of animal hides. While painted hides are common in other tribes, they usually do not have access to rich hunting grounds like us, making these big hides something that can be traded for a good price. Our traders have just come back. They bring riches with them."

 institution_events.80.t: "Investiture"
 institution_events.80.d: "In 1059 the Papacy established a College of Cardinals to self-ordain Popes by a purely clerical council, rather than allowing nobles to influence appointments. The Holy Roman Emperors were quick to try to preserve their rights of Investiture, however, over local bishops and abbots, setting in motion a violent conflict between Church and State. There is a silver lining to the growing unrest - a methodology of Investiture can eventually be worked out with the mutual consent of all parties, leaving a more sophisticated system of Religio-Social hierarchy in place."

 institution_events.801.t: "Libertas Ecclesiae"
 institution_events.801.d: "Since the early Middle Ages, simony, priestly marriage and lay investiture had been growing in the Catholic Church, although these sins were proscribed, often caused by the lack of adequate education of the minor clergy in the past. Several Popes started to remedy these abuses in the mid-11th century with a series of ecclesiastical reforms, also aimed at preserving the freedom of the Church from secular influence. Spiritual centers in Italy, France and Germany backed these reforms, further developing and spreading them.\nAs support for these reforms continues to grow everywhere, we should likewise consider promoting and implementing these papal reforms in [Root.GetName] ourselves, trying to end centuries of political and social upheaval, doctrinal ignorance and the petty venality among the clergy."

 institution_events.74.d: "Several universities claim to be the oldest in Europe, based on various criteria of measurement and semi-apocryphal records of when teaching began in their area. Regardless of who started first, by the middle of the 12th century organized didactic institutions existed across the Western world, from Bologna to Oxford to Paris. In $YEAR$, tutors and learned lecturers in theology, philosophy, classics, science, and other subjects can be heard imparting their knowledge to new generations of young nobles, allowing for a dissemination of academic expertise around the continent. The phenomenon was not limited to Christian powers, as the Islamic world too had a long-established education system where some of the greatest minds of the Middle Ages tabulated their theories, taking influence from Asian and Indian expertise."

 institution_events.741.t: "Lawless Students"
 institution_events.741.d: "Universities emerging in [Root.GetName] do often enjoy numerous governmental or clerical privileges, granting professors and students privileges over common townspeople. Frequently, these privileges also affect politics, trading of goods, or social life. It is not uncommon for students and townspeople to clash and engage in violent or even armed conflicts. Regardless of the outcome, such disputes are usually decided in favor of the academies, as they are usually not subject to the city's jurisdiction.\nA notably brutal confrontation has now occurred in [institution_province.GetName] when a squabble between some students and an innkeeper has escalated. The initial brawl spread to a riot throughout the province within two days, with students complaining about high rent and food costs, while townspeople rail against the students' privileges as well as their recurring misbehavior.\nNow that the mayor of [institution_province.GetCapitalName] has been attacked by the rioters, he is asking us for support."

 institution_events.75.t: "Rise of Guilds"
 institution_events.75.d: "With the rise of academic institutions, it is only natural that institutions of trade should abound as well, letting the bourgeoisie claim their own power alongside the landed gentry. Guilds were associations of merchants and craftsmen, centered around the structure of the City, often with the support of Royal decree. Growing out of post-conquest English law, guilds spread throughout Europe like wildfire in the twelfth and thirteenth century, with an explosion in $YEAR$. The structure of the guild could be replicated on even larger scales, with entire cities banding together into similar leagues of cooperation. The 'Hansa', first mentioned as such in 1267, was a particularly powerful association of traders which controlled Northern European mercantile life for centuries."

 institution_events.751.d: "The craftsmen and artisans of [Root.GetName] have always been prominent for their excellent craftsmanship. The establishment of guilds has transformed these simple craftsmen into a wealthy middle class that is gaining more and more power in the town. Many members of the city council are now former artisans who have amassed fortunes with their work.\nThis fact, however, displeases the noble patricians of the city, who have always had exclusive sway in the city. Now, the question arises whether we should preserve the supremacy of the patricians through a royal decree, or whether we should grant this dominion to the guilds."

 institution_events.76.d: "Chivalric codes of knightly virtue have existed in some form for several centuries, but the 1300s saw them reach their height under such developments as the outbreak of the Hundred Years War. Off the battlefield, knights were encouraged to embody ideals of courtliness, service of the needy, piety, and fairness in competition. These ideals were encoded both in general social mores and in specific works of literature, which spread the romanticized concept of a knight far and wide in $YEAR$."

At many prestigious palaces, the Accolade, a festive initiation rite, is becoming part of courtly culture. A squire who has proven his chivalrous virtues before, usually kneels in front of his liege lord and is raised to the rank of Knight by tapping his shoulder with a sword blade. This brings him respect and fame for the rest of his life.\n[Root.Heir.GetName] has grown into a handsome young man who will one day rule [Root.GetName] benevolently, making him an excellent choice to become the very first Knight in our [Root.GovernmentName].

However, from the ashes, by the turn of $YEAR$ a newfound attention to public health has emerged. Drawing together the anatomic expertise of Islamic scholarship and Ancient Greek materialists, doctors roam the lands trying to minimize the damage and prevent further outbreaks of disease. Though they know nothing of the vectors which actually translate Bubonic Plague, certain strategies of quarantine and cleanliness have found currency in regions like Milan and saved them from apocalypse.

The ball started rolling with figures like John Wycliffe and his Lollard heresy in England, but it wasn't until Jan Hus electrified the European continent that the true weight of populist theological movements was felt. With the contemporary clergy and laity of $YEAR$ both asking pointed questions about ancient traditions, the path lies open for more sophisticated religious hierarchies and secular reasoning.

Moreover, clerics were typically highly respected figures who were regarded as patrons of the religion, both among the nobility and the peasantry.\nHowever, with religious and institutional reforms on the horizon, parts of the nobility ventures to join the [Root.Religion.GetName] lay movements, granting the laity the right to preach critical sermons and distribute pamphlets exposing the atrocities of the [Root.GetAdjective] clergy.

Rural populations flock to the cities to find work in new factories, while materiels are pumped out at an astonishing rate to support public and military demand.

Separation of powers, equal rights for all men and women, free market capitalism, an end to feudalism, even utopian socialism have all been put forth in the context of this new radical Liberal movement seizing Europe and beyond.\nThough the spectre looms large, all the powers of Old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise it: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.

 institution_events.831.d: "A radical agitator for universal suffrage has seized upon the economic downturns within our nation to galvanize the masses into protest. The demonstrators gathered around a platform in $PROVINCENAME$ and began to rile up the crowds when the local governor sent police to arrest the ringleader. In their attempts to apprehend him, they accidentally knocked over a woman and killed a small child, leading to mass rioting almost instantaneously.\nThe governor is now asking that the federal authorities send in an army of hussars to disperse the rioting crowds, but doing so may only worsen the problem by killing more civilians.

#Chinese Empire
 china_events.1.d: "It seems the local officials of the Veche in [trade_problems_province.GetName] has taken it upon themselves to stimulate local commerce. A series of regulations issued have, while quite contrary to official policy, managed to provoke a local trade boom, with many local families getting into lucrative business while also attracting foreign merchants from overseas. The Posadniks are, however, imploring us to shut them down and retract the local stipulations as they are an affront to good governance and central power."
 china_events.2.d: "As merchants from every corner of the world seek out the rich cities of the Kievan Rus it is no wonder that some will at times encounter groups they consider to be their enemies. Local officials are puzzled by a number of of disturbances in [port_incident_location.GetName] that seem related to two such competing groups trying to establish themselves in the same region.\nFearing that the unrest will spread our Bojars are suggesting that we close down the markets and remove any foreigners in the area. The local Veche, however, instead recommend that we fine both sides but allow them to continue purchasing our goods."
 china_events.3.d: "By employing a tactic of constantly tailing the Grand Prince and building trust with him at every opportunity, court factions have managed to outmaneuver several previously influential courtiers and are increasingly gaining influence over the day to day palatial rulings."
 china_events.4.d: "A powerful minister at the Princely Court has died due to old age. The death of this eminence has left a vacuum that the other factions are now seeking to fill. However, his passing goes beyond petty court politics. It is a profound loss for the Grand Principality and we are expected to provide the man with a stately funeral as a token of our appreciation."

Our officials have identified an area that has suffered in particular during the last few years. It would blossom if we could only stop the water from threatening the livelihood of the locals."
 china_events.6.d: "One of our most respected courtiers has presented us with an expensive gift in the form of an enormous and carefully constructed countryside manor.

 china_events.10.d: "An influential proponent of the military at court has harbored a dark secret. For some time, the courtier in question has been under the influence of an ever worsening and consuming alcohol addiction. Despite flagrant rumors circulating this Marshal insists that the matter be kept under a lid. He promises that he will try to reform his ways, and to try to practice moderation in the future."
 china_events.13.d: "Officials have undertaken a project to expand the levy in [levy_province.GetName] by improving and updating the local censuses. The reform promises to bring additional manpower to the army, and improve the province's future troop recruitment. The Posadniks, however, would argue that leaving the locals alone would likely increase the value of the province more long term."
 china_events.14.d: "One of our Field Marshals has been caught red-handed siphoning off funds intended for our defenses. He is a disgrace to his family and for himself.

 china_events.16.d: "Word has reached you that a truly exceptional essay has been written in one of your provinces. It argues convincingly and in excellent literary style that it is folly to expect a country to be rich from increasing taxes. Our examiners describe this text as 'profoundly crafted' and there is no doubt that it will give rise to a new style for political essays for years to come.\nThe meat of the essay itself, however, cannot be ignored. The argument that avoiding high taxes makes the people as a whole richer and therefore the Grand Principality itself richer is a classical wisdom it is easy to overlook."

They believe opening up more channels for trade and cooperation would be beneficial for both of our countries. Some would rather argue that [country_of_interest.GetName] should submit to the authority of the Kievan Rus.\nThe foreign ambassador has been summoned to the [Root.GetAdjective] palace.

 china_events.26.d: "Court officials are worried that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is being unduly influenced by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] consort.

Everywhere you look there is a forest of spears and swords, aiming in defiance at the heavens above. Several powerful generals and marshals are present. Over the past few years these men have done everything in their power to strengthen the army.\nThe safety of the Kievan Rus depends on these troops, but it is not unheard of for a strong General to covet the Grand Princely throne himself..."
 china_events.34.d: "Melting glass particles onto metal surfaces to create ornate decorations and the art of enamelling is expected of every great artist.

In our chancellery [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is known to be an expert enamelist, producing great works for the glory of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dynasty.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has lately taken a great interest in this art, studying the work of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] in detail, impressed by the beauty and elegant work. It has therefore come as a great shock when a lesser official confessed that the allegory of the lauded works of [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] have frequently been veiled criticism of Princely Power."
 china_events.35.d: "A strong army has always been required to secure the borders of the Kievan Rus. In times of weakness the savages in the regions outside of our reach have never hesitated to raid or even invade our lands.\nTo ensure our safety the commanderies are asking to send expeditions into the frontier regions, probing the strength of the Barbarians while also demonstrating our might."

Loyalties will doubtlessly change on account of such an impressive gift delivered directly from the Grand Prince's own hand. Who shall we give it to?"

 china_events.40.d: "The teachings of Vladimir the Great stress the importance of understanding and respecting our traditional virtues that weave the web of society, and one of the most important relationships is that between father and son. Those who have gone before us deserve our thanksgiving, and it has been long enough since last we made an offering. Various courtiers have suggested sacrifices that your Majesty could perform. What seems most appropriate to present as an offering to honor the ancestors?"
 china_events.42.d: "One of your Marshals has been insulted by a high ranking official of the Posadniks. Apparently the men have had a hard time getting along for quite some time, and the insult was probably not entirely unprovoked.

Remembering the last days of Pagan rule our officials are categorizing these sects as members of the Rodnovery society but in truth it seems there is a great disparity in their motivations.\nWhat they do have in common, however, is the goal of disruption chaos and the overthrowing of our established and perceived oppressive rule."

A few minutes later the disc has passed by the sun, and light returns. You are shaken by the experience, but many of your subjects are absolutely terrified. Some whisper that the eclipse proves that Fraternity has passed from our dynasty. What should we make of this situation?"
 china_events.50.d: "Integrating Greek principles into our society is excellent for turning out well educated and thoroughly competent bureaucrats and officials, ready to face the various challenges of day to day rule and administration that the Kievan Rus possess.\nThat same education is, however, now making our administrators very weary of some of the measures we have been taking recently. Believing the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to be acting without mutual Fraternity has made many officials unwilling to comply with our demand. At times it would seem Grand Princely authority doesn't stretch further than one can see from the palace walls."
 china_events.51.d: "It is becoming more and more apparent that the power of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is waning and that the Grand Princely center is unable to rule the Kievan Rus, much less maintain any kind of authority over the outer states.\nWith the refusal of the [unruly_subject.GetAdjective] to submit before what they believe to be an illegitimate Grand Prince it seems our influence beyond our borders has deteriorated sharply."
 china_events.52.d: "Plagues, famines, droughts and calamities are becoming increasingly frequent in $COUNTRY$ these days, and now a particularly nasty disease has arrived at court. Yesterday morning a Voivode employed at the Public Works Office was found dead after having complained of a sore throat the day before. The disease is now spreading throughout the court, and several more are already showing symptoms. Fraternity is no longer with us, it would appear."

A courtier has been murdered, found in his bedchamber with a blade buried deep in his back, and several stab wounds to the rest of his body. Fratricide and internal strife are becoming ever more common in $COUNTRY$, and many believe that we no longer enjoy mutual Fraternity."
 china_events.54.d: "For the past nine months you have been an expecting father, and today one of your concubines did indeed give birth to a son. The joy is cut short, however, when the child is brought before you. His face is deformed into what looks like a permanent scream, and soft, black fur-like hair grows in patches over his little body.

A spy sent into the garden on a full moon night returns with disturbing news: The Posadnik spends his nights standing in his garden, howling at the moon."
 china_events.59.d: "Terrible news reach us from the Dnieper River, where a number tax barges, carrying a substantial amount of the taxes for $YEAR$, has sunk during a particularly nasty bout of bad weather. The Posadniks of the Treasury interprets these events as a sign that our dynasty no longer enjoys mutual Fraternity, and argues that we must accept and respect this turn of providence. How shall we respond to these ill tidings?"
 china_events.60.d: "Provinces have reported to the capital that they are now in full compliance with several sets of new princely edicts, the only problem is that you've never issued any such edicts.

Since our divorce from the Byzantine rite, however, there has been a newfound attention to perceived abuses within the church. An inquisitory force dispatched to Occitania from the French Crown has discovered that such sentiments have finally reached a boiling point as a new faction labelling itself 'Cathar' - 'Pure' - has taken hold in $PROVINCENAME$. These Cathars are neo-Gnostics and believe that they can achieve 'perfection' by living in ascetic self-denial.\nThe Holy Father would be most displeased if we do not take action against their practices."
 hohenref_events.1.a: "Arrest them immediately!"
 hohenref_events.2.t: "The Waldensian Heresy"
 hohenref_events.2.d: "A wealthy merchant named Waldes in $PROVINCENAME$ has taken up the Cathar mantle by giving away all his possessions and embracing a life of 'perfection'. The only trouble is, he has organized many other townspeople to join him in a sort of rabble-rousing mission. Chanting their motto 'Lux Lucet In Tenebris', they are spreading the radical and dangerous idea that salvation will come most easily to those who live in Apostolic Poverty. They levy attacks directly against the Church, claiming its richness is an affront to scripture, and prattle on about camels traveling through needle-eyes.\nWith two different heresies now discovered in Southern France, the Holy Father will surely be apoplectic!"
 hohenref_events.2.a: "Have this Waldes re-educated."
 hohenref_events.3.t: "A Bosnian Church?"
 hohenref_events.3.d: "Seizing on rife unrest regarding the religious establishment, a faction within Bosnia has proposed a separation from both the Catholic and Orthodox churches, decrying the very notion of a state-influencing church as contrary to scriptural wisdom. Though most view them as another incarnation of the Bogomilist heresy, they deny the accusation, and insist that the truest path for Bosnia is to embrace our own church where no far-away powers can impose their will on us, and practitioners will restrict themselves to private matters of conscience."
 hohenref_events.3.a: "This sounds like a great idea."
 hohenref_events.3.b: "Church without power is no church!"
 hohenref_events.4.t: "The Fraticelli Heresy"
 hohenref_events.4.d: "Saint Francis is, of course, an eminently respected Catholic hero. However, discontent within the order has led a certain monk named Angelo Clareno to promote a new, extremist branch of 'Spiritual Franciscans' who advocate complete poverty and regard the established Church's wealth as damning. They claim any ecclesiastic figure who holds personal wealth forfeits his holy status, and encourage the poor masses into their hermetic lifestyle. Though some have attempted to reach a concordance with the Papacy, Clareno insists on open disobedience. This wouldn't be such a problem, if it wasn't spilling out right into our lands.\nThe Holy Father will be quite wroth if we let this heresy blossom on his doorstep."
 hohenref_events.4.a: "Throw this mad monk in prison."
 hohenref_events.4.b: "Offer him a chilled nectarine."
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9100: "Lollards were a heretical group following the theological teaching of disgraced Oxford professor John Wycliffe, who contended that Bibles should be translated into the vernacular. Popular protests against the wealth, power, and pride of the clergy were frequent, and in times of disorder would express themselves in an extreme form. Church inquisitors have already tried to persecute these Lollards several times in the past, but friends in high places have protected them so far. Now, it seems they are getting out of control."
 hohenref_events.5.t: "The Hussite Heresy"
 hohenref_events.5.d: "It's happening again. Feelings of anger at the [Root.Religion.GetName] establishment have manifested in a [Root.GetAdjective] preacher named Jan Hus, who attacks the Holy Church itself from his pulpit and spreads controversial ideas on the Eucharist and other ecclesiastical matters. His central thesis is that the universal church is morally bankrupt and must be reformed wholesale, and he has accrued quite a large and violent following. Every action church officials take to restrict his doctrines only causes more unrest.\nWe must wipe these Hussites out before they snowball into a paramilitary army!"

 black_death.1.d: "We have heard that it began somewhere in the East, and that a certain sieging horde army on the Black Sea spread it to foolish Genoese tradesmen, who had brought it to their homeland before they knew anything was off. Regardless of where it came from, it's here. Black welts drawn straight from the maw of Hell cover infected citizens and soon lead them to almost certain death - the Greeks have taken to calling these vile inflammations 'buboes', while learned men around the continent try desperately to find an effective treatment. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has isolated [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in the governmental palaces to avoid contracting the disease, but it seems to strike everywhere. Neither gods nor kings can withstand its influence, which some theorize corrupts the air itself. For now, we can only pray the outbreak of the disease will be brief, and our nation will not be too destabilized by this turn of events."

 black_death.2.b: "Damage Control with quarantines!"
 black_death.3.t: "Minor Outbreak"

 black_death.4.t: "Troops Infected"
 black_death.4.d: "It was only natural that once the disease started hitting the civilian population it would spread to armies - after all, it was an army that brought it to our continent.

[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has been infected by the Black Death, and even the best-trained natural philosophers worry this might be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death.

 black_death.6.d: "It seemed unthinkable, and has brought great grief to the heart of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. [Root.Heir.GetName] has been stricken by the Black Death, and now clings onto life by only a fateful thread. In truth, [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] death could mean the descent of the state into lawless anarchy and civil war if the rest of the royal family is also wiped out."

 black_death.7.d: "The Pope has gotten wind of our attempts to combat the Black Death and claims our use of unceremonious burials, experimentation on cadavers, and co-opting of church resources is an unholy outrage. He maintains that even in these trying times we must observe the faith if we are to survive. The legate he sent awaits our assurances that we will end such practices and reimburse the church."

 black_death.8.a: "Send funding immediately!"
 black_death.8.b: "We cannot afford it"
 black_death.9.t: "Paranoid Unrest"
 black_death.9.d: "The citizens of one of our provinces have heard grim rumors about how the state deals with infected populations, and the severity of quarantines. Several rabble-rousers have driven the populace into a frenzy, ready to boil over into open revolt, unless we recall all plague-fighting officials and assure them no quarantines will be issued against their towns."
 black_death.9.a: "Bow to the demands"
 black_death.9.b: "We'll show them death..."
 black_death.10.t: "Foreign Advice"
 black_death.10.d: "One of the neighboring states has succeeded in clearing the Black Death from their population and fortifying their borders against further outbreaks. They have gracefully sent learned men to give us advice on how to fight this unholy disease in our own lands."
 black_death.10.a: "A great boon!"
 black_death.100.t: "End of the Black Death"
 black_death.100.d: "It would seem that the ravages of the Black Death have finally burned themselves out, as medical advancements and population thinning have rendered them powerless. The citizenry is cautiously returning to normal life and even a few trading hubs have re-opened business. Though the disease was damaging to our nation, we emerge more resilient than ever."

One final male claimant remains, a great grandson of Eadweard the Confessor's father, Aethelred the Unready - they call him Edgar the 'Aetheling', meaning 'Prince'. The remnants of the old Saxon witenagemot have proclaimed him King in defiance of our rule, and many disenfranchised nobles have already flocked to his cause!

In the narrow passage at Manzikert, the two great armies met in an unavoidable engagement.\n\nAs the dust kicked up by the fearsome horses cleared, the full extent of the catastrophe became apparent. The cowardly 'mercenary' Franks had abandoned the battlefield, and the ancient Varangian Guard was wiped out entirely.

Now, however, internal politics have led Byzantine traitors to buy the Turks' support by turning open the gates of major Bithynian cities to a Seljuk prince... a heathen who has the gall to call himself 'Sultan of Rum'! This villain has directed his full attention toward the complete conquest of Anatolia and the export of Islam to the west."

 byz_crisis.21.d: "The Strategos of the Theme of Iberia has concluded that the imperial government cannot defend him and he will have to take over all military and administrative affairs in his own province. In effect, he has begun to act independent of the empire in all but name. With all the chaos the Turks are causing in the rest of Anatolia, it seems fruitless to attempt to rein him back in again."

 byz_crisis.22.t: "Tzachas"
 byz_crisis.22.d: "There are many scions of the Oghuz turks active in Asia minor, and some are more important than others. Lesser princes far from the royal line of succession may even act against the main Turkish forces, cooperating with Greeks to advance their own interests.\n\nOne such prince is a pirate and warlord known to us as 'Tzachas', who has rebelled against our employment and taken up residence in the islands along the Aegean coast of Asia minor. Though he is hostile to many other Islamic powers, his powerbase is nevertheless dangerously close to Greece itself, and he has even taken to styling himself Byzantine Emperor, plotting to capture our capital."
 byz_crisis.22.a: "Maybe we can work with him..."
 byz_crisis.22.b: "I want his head!"
 byz_crisis.23.t: "Cilicia Slips Away"
 byz_crisis.23.d: "In days past we assigned the governorship of Tarsus and Cilicia at large to a curious Armenian from the noble Artsruni line who bore the Arabic name 'Abu'l-Gharib'. He is better known to us as Apnelgaripes, and has proved loyal in the past due to his conversion to the Orthodox Church, which in turn has incurred the resentment of his own Miaphysite people. Despite this liability, he has begun acting independently of the Imperial government and has essentially made himself prince of the Armenians in Cilicia."
 byz_crisis.23.a: "Let his own people take care of him"
 byz_crisis.23.b: "He must remain loyal!"

 byz_crisis.24.d: "Crete was once a haven for Arab pirates to raid and harass the Greek people from right on our doorstep. Thankfully, it was recovered by Nikephoros Phokas a century ago. More recently it has been placed under the command of our naval Megas Doux, but its governor, a certain Karykes, has revolted against the weakened Imperial state to foolishly seek out independence on the grounds that we are not protecting the island from Turkish piracy.\n\nThe loss of Crete will be a great blow to our naval strategy and our control of trade through the Aegean Sea."

 byz_crisis.24.b: "We cannot afford to lose Crete again"
 byz_crisis.25.t: "Seljuks in Lydia"
 byz_crisis.25.d: "Though the main Seljuk force that attacked Anatolia was under prince Suleiman, another division commanded by the lesser dynast Tengribirmish focused their efforts in the region of Lydia and in particular the holy city of Ephesos. Tengribirmish has successfully captured many of the important forts in the region and rather than swearing allegiance to the far-away Seljuk Padishah, he has decided to found his own state on our lands!"
 byz_crisis.25.a: "This is getting out of hand..."
 byz_crisis.25.b: "Now there are two of them?"
 byz_crisis.100.t: "Komnenian Restoration"
 byz_crisis.100.d: "With much of Anatolia lost, the Byzantine [Root.GovernmentName] is in a state of chaos, now dealing with attempted conquests by the Seljuks and ambitious Italian powers. The current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s weakness has caused unrest throughout the heartlands, and a skilled general named Alexios Komnenos has proved his worth by putting down many rebellions and defending against hostile powers.\nThis Alexios seems to have near universal support, and abdicating in favor of him might be the only way to save Byzantium from further calamities. However, doing so might also open the [Root.GovernmentName] up to even more invasions under the pretext of monarchical illegitimacy."

The sudden death of the last Árpád monarch under suspicious circumstances has caused the complete collapse of the Hungarian state, as local nobles seize any land outside the core Hungarian heartland and rule it with de-facto independent control.

By forcing them to refrain from arbitrarily raised customs duties, by demanding the king's permission to build new castles, and by placing the local nobility under royal jurisdiction, we will certainly be able to restrict the autonomy of [UNG.Monarch.GetName]'s relatives and regain control of Ung for the Hungarian Crown."

 peoples_spring.1.d: "The continuing social problems of recent years, such as poverty, famine, the decline of traditional crafts and general social hardships, have led to the revolt of the [Root.GetAdjective] proletariat. After an assembly lasting several days, its representatives presented a collection of liberal and democratic demands, such as guaranteeing freedom of the press and the establishment of a parliament, to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the [Root.GetAdjective] state. The coming weeks will be decisive for the future of our nation when it will be seen how far these revolutionaries can impose their demands."

 peoples_spring.2.d: "In many of our provinces, factory workers have laid down their weapons to demonstrate against the terrible living and working conditions. Many of them work for ten hours or more a day, live in ghettos or slums, have no social insurances, are underpaid and even children often have to work in the factories. Should we try to improve their situation or oppress them?"

We must counteract this immediately!"

 peoples_spring.4.d: "Fearing to lose their jobs due to the advancing mechanization caused by industrialization, many impoverished factory workers in [manufactory_province.GetName] have joined the national uprisings. In order to demand better wages and working conditions from the entrepreneurs and to prevent the hiring of unskilled but cheap labour, they have destroyed the factories' machinery or devastated the building sites of factories under construction. Our economy will suffer significantly if further factories have to be closed down entirely because of such riots."

Inspired by the performance of a nationalist opera, Belgian revolutionaries have begun to loot and occupy government buildings in our cities throughout the country, on which the Belgian tricolor now wafts.\nThe newly convened assembly of revolutionaries demands the separation of Belgian territory from the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] and the recognition of an independent Belgian nation. This is an outrageous demand, but it may prove to be the only way to overcome the crisis in the long term."

 peoples_spring.9.d: "Decades of cultural and religious differences in the lowlands have resulted in the emergence of a Belgian [BGU.GovernmentName], that has broken away from the Netherlands. Consequently, the Dutch [NED.Monarch.GetTitle] will desperately try to regain the territories occupied by the Belgians by all possible means, which brings up the question of whether we should intervene in this conflict and assist the Belgian revolutionaries.\nBy supporting this Belgian state, we will not only be able to gain a valuable ally, but also strengthen our trade influence in the North Sea against Dutch merchants."

 peoples_spring.10.d.a: "A political agitator named Karl Marx has recently come to prominence for his critiques of [Root.GetAdjective] society. He has been organizing meetings with other intellectuals who share his beliefs, and spreading dangerous ideas through pamphlets and public proclamations. He claims that the the power of the global aristocracy has been usurped by the bourgeoisie, turning [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s into mere puppets, and that in turn the common people will inevitably rise up to overthrow these upstart burghers and establish their own stateless societies!\nMarx's proposals are deeply threatening, but arresting him may only make things worse. Perhaps we could grudgingly allow him to continue and keep an eye on his cohorts."
 peoples_spring.10.d.b: "Building off the writings and theories of the radical Karl Marx, another German thinker named Friedrich Engels has spread similar 'communistic' ideas within our state. In particular, he has criticized the abject conditions of the [Root.GetAdjective] working class, claiming they sell their humanity piecemeal by the day for pittances. This inane slander of our beneficent government and society should not be allowed to continue!\nAt the same time, simply censoring Engels may only make his dangerous ideas more appealing to the masses. We must tread carefully in dealing with this man."
 peoples_spring.10.d.c: "A certain writer who haunts various intellectual spheres in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has recently made a name for himself with his radical pamphlets advocating for the so-called 'communist' ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. These pamphlets are being widely read by the [Root.GetAdjective] masses and aristocracy alike, and have caused quite a stir. It has been claimed that this radical author is advocating open sedition against our government!\nIf we arrest this man and put a stop to his pamphleteering, it may only suggest to the people that we consider him a threat. Perhaps ignoring him would be better."

 peoples_spring.11.t: "The Greek Revolution"
 peoples_spring.11.d: "Centuries of boiling revolutionary sentiment have been bolstered by the recent rise of nationalism among the ethnic minorities in our [Root.GovernmentName] to produce open defiance among the Greeks. Under the leadership of a series of radical thinkers and leaders such as Alexandros Ypsilantis and Theodoros Kolokotronis, they are now demanding that the Sublime Porte recognize their full autonomy, and threaten that the streets of Athens will run with Ottoman blood if we do not give in to their demands!\nThis insolence is unprecedented, but the Greeks have widespread support among the Kafirs, who have the outrageous idea that our [Root.GovernmentName] is in a state of decline. Behind our backs they mock us as 'the sick man of Europe'."
 peoples_spring.11.a: "We must accept this"
 peoples_spring.11.b: "We'll show them a 'sick man'..."
 peoples_spring.12.t: "Greece Calls for Aid"
 peoples_spring.12.d: "The newly-established Greek [GRE.Monarch.GetTitle] [GRE.Monarch.GetName] has called upon the powers of Europe to proclaim their support for the Greek state in the face of Ottoman aggression. Due to the popularity of the Philhellene movement among Western poets and painters this appeal has wide public support, especially after a French painter named Eugène Delacroix made a widely-reproduced dramatization of a recent Turkish massacre of Greek civilians.\nIf we do not step in to assist the Greeks, the Ottomans may soon move back in to re-annex their state once the public eye has moved elsewhere."

The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must bring these issues under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] control in order to prevent a permanent collapse of the Caliphate.\nSome of our viziers regard this as a divine trial to challenge our Caliphate. However, this allegation should be treated with caution as this catastrophe was rather precipitated by our own mismanagement."

 great_fitna.3.t: "Corruption At Court"
 great_fitna.3.d: "The court officials increasingly work against each other instead of trying to master the unfortunate circumstances of our Caliphate together.

But with the diminishing influence we exert on this region, [HED.Monarch.GetSheHe] was no longer able to stop Sunni preachers and missionaries from evangelizing in [HED.Monarch.GetHerHis] realm.\nIf we were to lose the holiest sites of Islam, it would be a severe blow to our Caliphal authority.

 great_fitna.7.d: "It has come to our attention that our Levantine territories have not been as badly hit by the constant anarchy as other parts of the Caliphate. We owe this mainly to the governor of Damascus, the Armenian general Badr al-Jamali. He kept rebellious troops in check and rationed supplies to the civilian population.\nTruly, this man is one of the most capable people who have sworn allegiance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We could now request his assistance in order to pacify the other parts of the Caliphate as well. However, we should also be aware that he could exploit our weakness for personal gain."

 great_fitna.8.d: "We had not expected Badr al-Jamali to take such a tough approach:\nOn the very same day that he arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], he invited all commanders of the rebellious Mamluks of the city to a banquet. Since they did not know the reason for the visit of the Armenian general, they did not suspect him of ill intentions upon his arrival. When they set off drunk one after another at late hours, they were individually strangled by al-Jamali's men.\nNow that we have regained control of the capital for the time being, al-Jamali demands the position as supreme vizier. He promises to eliminate remaining rebels and pacify the country so that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will eventually regain full control of the Caliphate. Do we want to get involved in his effective but cruel schemes?"
 great_fitna.8.a: "Appoint him as the most empowered vizier."

 great_fitna.9.t: "Army Dissension"
 great_fitna.9.d: "Reports of violent clashes within our army are becoming increasingly frequent - especially between Turkish mamluks and Nubian, Berber or Syrian soldiers on the other. This was made clear when [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], while walking through [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], had to watch with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own eyes how a drunken mamluk was murdered by a Nubian mob after he had attacked a Nubian soldier.\nWe must finally choose one of the two sides in order not to have both groups as our enemy, but at the same time we must prevent ourselves from becoming the puppet of one of the factions!"

 great_fitna.11.b: "Make them come to their senses."
 great_fitna.12.t: "Autonomous Governors"
 great_fitna.12.d: "The crumbling authority of the Caliphate has led to a desire for greater self-rule in many parts of our empire. The wealthy coastal towns of the Levant are particularly affected, where the local merchant aristocracy regularly suspends tax payments to us. Supposedly they are striving to shake off our suzerainty completely in order to be able to trade and accumulate riches peacefully."

With the connivance of treacherous viziers, they coerced the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to relinquish [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] reign, exiling [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] from the very land [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] once ruled.\n In [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stead, they elevated a feeble and inexperienced figurehead to the throne, a mere pawn in their grand scheme. Although the insurgents presently cease hostilities, this perilous coup shall inflict unparalleled harm upon the Caliphate, rendering it feeble and vulnerable like never before.

In a newfound fascination for the original Abrahamic religion we have done what we can to integrate them in our rites, traditions and education. As we have strived to harmonize Bogomilist texts with the teachings of the Torah Jewish philosophers, traders, soldiers and artisans have become evermore present parts of our society. Eventually as traditions fuse these people have become a cornerstone of our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 confucian_events.5.a: "We welcome them"
 confucian_events.6.t: "Assimilation of Gnostics"
 confucian_events.6.d: "The bearers of a tradition that is said to be even older than our own the Gnostics are a people that have seen their political influence come and then fade. It was clear that we had much to learn from these teachings, as they could learn much from our superior tradition of reason, justice and fairness. When communities such as the one in [zoroastrian_province.GetName] became part of our [Root.GovernmentName] it allowed our traditions to begin a new phase of harmonization, fusing the ancient teachings of their prophets with those of Bogomil. We are still a country where the classics are learned and lived by but Gnostics are now an integral part of our society and to some extent their wisdom has become ours."
 confucian_events.6.a: "We welcome them"
 confucian_events.10.t: "Assimilation of Buddhism"
 confucian_events.10.d: "Those of our subjects that are ardent followers of the great and mysterious Lamas have increasingly come to realize how useful an ideology the teachings of Bogomil are. Where they once used the traditions of the Tantrayana way to judge the world they are now incorporating the same classics that we have. Tantrayana monks and nobles are now part of our government both at the very top and at the very bottom and their somewhat wild and Tantric traditions appears to have been tamed by our reason and learning."
 confucian_events.10.a: "We welcome them"
 confucian_events.11.t: "Concept of God"
 confucian_events.11.d: "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate Bogomilist concepts and our rites in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of God with their own supreme saints. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faithful to integrate a number of Bogomilist concepts, rites, constants and classical teaching in their theology.\nThere is some debate in the palace halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves from infidels to true believers."
 confucian_events.12.d: "The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s are a people with strong traditions and rites and their adherence to the archaic language of their own teachings is holding them back from progressing towards civilization. If they are to ever elevate themselves from the Infidel Paganism of this world we must perhaps ensure that the traditions and the proper rites are available for them to digest in their own language.\nThere are some scholars that have already begun to create such works. Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of Jesus Christ?"
 confucian_events.13.d: "Our trusted minister and confidant, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has worked closely with our [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] community in order to help them elevate their infidel culture. Surprised at [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has started to adopt many [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] concepts after studying their science and literature intensely. Many worry that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has gotten too taken in by [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ways. Some even claim that our [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] has secretly converted, shaming [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] ancestors and the [Root.GovernmentName] alike."
 confucian_events.14.d: "While they are part of our [Root.GovernmentName] some [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] traditions can be very hard to stomach. A civilized people is supposed to abide by what is right and logical according the Bogomilist teachings, but these men and women have many customs in direct contradiction of such rules. Our officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their infidel ways."
 confucian_events.15.d: "While the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] are infidels, they have some customs and rites that we might make use of. As their traditions and ceremonies regarding rulership already contains a concept of a high worldly power such as our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] this is something we could make good use of. Local officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have already been doing so but it has been suggested that we make use of [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ceremonies even at higher levels. Others argue that we would be shaming our ancestors and turning our back on what is proper if we allowed these traditions to contaminate ours."
 confucian_events.16.d: "Over time the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s have come to take to many of our customs. When our [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] visited the area of [harmonization_province.GetName] [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] found that they are still far from civilized, however, and when a local influential landholder invited [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim] to participate in a naming ceremony for a child named for its father that was the last drop.\n[Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] returned from the area with a very low opinion of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s and of their prospects to ever count themselves among the civilized people of the world."
 confucian_events.17.d: "Some infidels are more susceptible to reason and intellect than others. The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s of [harmonization_province.GetName] have already taken to many of our traditions, from the more important to even minor things. Visiting foreigners have a hard time telling the region apart from [Root.GetName] proper as apart from some minor eccentricities the [Root.Capital.Culture.GetName] language, names and customs seem as [Root.GetAdjective] as any part of the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName]."
 confucian_events.18.t: "Feckless Heir?"
 confucian_events.18.d: "The rule of our great [Root.GovernmentName] is the foremost responsibility and privilege of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] have in the past prided themselves on leading through example, observing strict etiquette, personal austerity and carefully weeding out those that do not conform to this ideal.\nIt is therefore with a heavy heart that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has observed the development of [Root.Heir.GetName]. Far from an ideal [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] our royal heir is often described by [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] teachers as a petty person, focused on immediate gain and emotional pleasures. There are, however, factions at court that would be most dismayed if we abandoned [Root.Heir.GetName], a new heir would not have their support."
 confucian_events.18.a: "Such a [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] is not fit for our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 confucian_events.19.d: "A vernacular novel about a well-known story from ancient times is rapidly gaining popularity among our subjects. This in itself is not a problem but it has come to our attention that this novelization is in fact breaking central tenets of Bogomilist ideology as it could be seen as an argument for disobeying central authority and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nOur administrators now argue that the book must be banned, though some fear this will only make it more alluring to those that wish to read it."
 confucian_events.20.d: "Education, self-improvement and adherence to the traditions are the backbone of our government and if our [Root.GovernmentName] is to aspire to greatness we must at all times devote money, attention and energy to ensuring that our officials are as well educated and well informed as they can possibly be. It is therefore of some concern that the number of people seeking government employment seem to be decreasing as of late."
 confucian_events.20.a: "We must expand the royal court!"
#Shinto Nestorian Events
 shinto_events.1.t: "Hereditary Patriarchate"
 shinto_events.1.d: "The sitting Patriarch of the Church of the East, Shemon IV, has made the unprecedented decision to declare the Patriarchal Seat hereditary, and plans to pass it on to one of his relatives.\nMany Nestorians are outraged by this decision, but the Patriarchate nevertheless commands wide respect and obedience. This could eventually result in a full blown schism if we are not careful."
 shinto_events.1.a: "Denounce the nepotistic Patriarch!"
 shinto_events.1.b: "We can learn to live with this"
 shinto_events.2.t: "Contacts With Rome"
 shinto_events.2.d: "The unrest caused by the Patriarchal switch to hereditary succession has spurred some of the disaffected parties to turn back to the Roman Pontiff. Refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the Patriarch of the East, they obtain their ordinations from the Pope himself."
 shinto_events.2.a: "Permit it, for now"
 shinto_events.2.b: "We should start doing the same"
 shinto_events.2.c: "Execute these traitors!"
 shinto_events.3.t: "A Chaldean Church?"
 shinto_events.3.d: "It has become clear that the differences in agreement between the hereditary Patriarchate and its discontents are insurmountable. In fact, the clerics who have been turning towards Rome for ordination are now attempting to found their very own separate church that will be oriented Westward. This new church is called the Chaldean Catholic Church."
 shinto_events.3.a: "Consider us Chaldeans"
 shinto_events.3.b: "Good riddance to them"
 shinto_events.3.c: "I thought I said execute them?"
 shinto_events.4.t: "Chaldeans Prevail"
 shinto_events.4.d: "Our continued support for the Chaldean cause and condemnation of the Eliya line has resulted in the virtual overthrow of traditional Church practice in favor of a new Chaldean Rite, in closer contact with the Roman Papacy."
 shinto_events.4.a: "To new friends"
 shinto_events.5.t: "A House Divided"
 shinto_events.5.d: "The fate of the Church of the East remains murky, as both supporters of the traditional Eliya line and of the new Chaldean Shimun line have wide currency in our realm. For now, we must tolerate both of them and accept that it is time to move on."
 shinto_events.5.a: "We will survive"
 shinto_events.6.t: "End of the Schism"
 shinto_events.6.d: "Our tenacity in fighting the Chaldeans and Shimun line has resulted in its effective defeat in our lands and amount our peoples. The unified Church of the East remains, under one autonomous and legitimate Patriarch, the highest authority in all the lands."
 shinto_events.6.a: "True faith prevails"
 shinto_events.7.t: "The Rise of Regionalism"
 shinto_events.7.d: "The most important thing in any church is its unity, and this is no different for the Church of the East. Lately, however, regionalist and nationalistic sentiments have caused fractures to appear in the overarching church body. Different ethnic groups located in different parts of the Nestorian world are seeking further and further autocephalous privileges."
 shinto_events.7.a: "This will erode the faith"
 shinto_events.7.b: "Every city a Church"
 shinto_events.8.t: "Josephites"
 shinto_events.8.d: "An upstart group in Mesopotamia has gone as far as to found what they call a new legitimate line of Chaldean Patriarchs of the East, the Josephites. They encourage all of the faithful to switch allegiance to Patriarch Joseph I and hail him as the head of the church, denying the authenticity of the current Shimun line, which they claim has drifted away from Rome!"
 shinto_events.8.a: "More Catholic unionists?"
 shinto_events.8.b: "Let's listen to what he has to say"
 shinto_events.9.t: "Sectarian Tension"
 shinto_events.9.d: "This new rift between the Josephites and the original Shimun Patriarchal line has been causing tensions in some of our cities. It has come to our attention that traders from a Josephite area provoked a conflict that turned into an all-out riot in which dozens of people were killed.\nSurely this act cannot go unpunished?"
 shinto_events.9.a: "Let the Holy Father sort it out"
 shinto_events.9.b: "Investigate the perpetrators"
 shinto_events.9.c: "Who cares about the rabble?"
 shinto_events.10.t: "The Church is Fractured"
 shinto_events.10.d: "Our apathy toward regionalist tendencies and refusal to turn Westward in search of unifying principles has left the Church of the East separated into several competing Patriarchal lines situated in different locales, each with contradictory creeds and degrees of autocephaly. Given this condition, the Holy Father has little hope of steering the faith as a whole towards Rome."
 shinto_events.10.a: "And that's a good thing"
 shinto_events.11.t: "A Careful Status Quo"
 shinto_events.11.d: "The regionalism that has rocked the church in recent years has been somewhat controlled. Though the fervor is still detectably, the peoples of the different corners of our realm have accepted compromises allowing for some local autocephaly while still remaining under the jurisdiction of a high Patriarch."
 shinto_events.11.a: "Well handled"
 shinto_events.12.t: "Unity Under Rome"
 shinto_events.12.d: "By crushing the petty traditionalists that have assaulted the church in the last decade, we have preserved our faith in a freshly Rome-oriented manner. The Holy Father was crucial in using his apostolic legitimacy and resources to help the Josephite Patriarch hold onto his power and to stop the rabble from destroying the new universal church."
 shinto_events.12.a: "A new future awaits"
 shinto_events.13.t: "Timur the Lame"
 shinto_events.13.d: "Despite his nickname, the Turkic warlord Timur is no laughing matter. He has unified much of Eastern Persia under his banner, and has made it his mission to erase the Christian faith off the face of the earth and enforce the Mohammedian heathenry on all of us! Tales are told about his massacring of entire cities without the slightest care."
 shinto_events.13.a: "Beg the Roman Pope for help"
 shinto_events.13.b: "Let us pray he won't attack"
 shinto_events.13.c: "We will fight to the last man"
 shinto_events.14.t: "The Sack of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 shinto_events.14.d: "Our worst fears have come true. Tamerlane, like a demon sent to destroy our sinful realm, has led a raiding party into the heart of our nation and sacked [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], taking mountains of loot and slaves. The Holy Church was desecrated, and smaller parishes were burned to the ground.\nFor many, this is a sign from God that we have strayed from the true faith."
 shinto_events.14.a: "Start rebuilding immediately"
 shinto_events.14.b: "Christ suffered too"
 shinto_events.14.c: "We must turn to Rome"
 shinto_events.15.t: "Convert or Die"
 shinto_events.15.d: "Tamerlane himself has sent an ultimatum to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName]. We are to convert to the Muslim faith, profess the Shahada, and transform all our Nestorian churches into mosques immediately.\nIf we do not promptly obey, Tamerlane warns, the streets of our cities will run red with the blood of martyrs, including our very own [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire extended family."
 shinto_events.15.a: "The Church is ruined!"
 shinto_events.15.b: "We can pretend to convert"
 shinto_events.15.c: "It's a bluff"
 shinto_events.16.t: "The Scourge is Lifted"
 shinto_events.16.d: "At long last, Tamerlane's raids and invasions have ceased in our lands. Though he was a powerful foe of the true faith, his threats turned out to be largely empty, and the one Nestorian Church remains as strong as ever. We have demonstrated the zeal of the East, and the fact that we will not trade our sovereignty for assistance."
 shinto_events.16.a: "Ring the bells"
 shinto_events.17.t: "Tamerlane's Shadow"
 shinto_events.17.d: "Though Tamerlane has at long last ceased his harrowing of our realm, the memory of him looms over the populace. There are few families that didn't count among them a martyr, or lose their property to his Turkish marauders. Tamerlane has been a blight on the Church of the East that will remain on our conscience for centuries to come."
 shinto_events.17.a: "By God's grace"
 shinto_events.18.t: "The Church Has Been Humbled"
 shinto_events.18.d: "Tamerlane's relentless onslaught and our inability to mount an effective local defense has spelled the virtual demise of the Church of the East in Persia and the rest of Asia. With our numbers greatly reduced, the Church is closer to the orbit of Rome than ever, as many see the still rich and powerful Catholic Church as the only option for future protection."
 shinto_events.18.a: "What shame"
 shinto_events.19.t: "Abbasids Demand Jizya"
 shinto_events.19.d: "Those faithful to the Church of the East living under the nominal rule of the Abbasid Caliph have long been used to the mere ceremonial nature of the Caliphal office, after the Caliphate disintegrated centuries ago. Now, however, the power of the Caliphs is waxing and they have dared to demand further payments of the Jizya tax from the already tax-laden peasants.\nA lowly ambassador has come to us asking for help and guarantees in the face of these Abbasid presumptions."
 shinto_events.19.a: "Render Unto Caesar..."
 shinto_events.19.b: "Do everything in our power"
 shinto_events.20.t: "Shari'a Courts"
 shinto_events.20.d: "The persecuted Nestorians living under the heathens are now telling us that they have often been forced to solve legal disputes in Islamic Shari'a courts, according to Islamic law. This is in contrast with certain ancient rights given to Christian minorities allowing a degree of self-governance. Clearly the new Caliphs seek to put pressure on the Christian faith and erode the foundations of the Church of the East."
 shinto_events.20.a: "They should leave for the West"
 shinto_events.20.b: "We must condemn the Caliph"
 shinto_events.21.t: "Caliphal Depositions"
 shinto_events.21.d: "A great outrage has rocked the Church of the East - the current Sunni Caliph has forced the deposition of the Nestorian Patriarch! The Caliph accused the Patriarch with trumped up charges, but in reality was afraid of the Patriarch's anti-Abbasid stances and the mass of angry citizens that were being riled up by his sermons.\nThe Caliph does not expect us to dare question his actions, but our legitimacy will be greatly shaken in the minds of many Nestorians if we do not join other Church leaders in denouncing this action and demanding the re-instatement of the old Patriarch."
 shinto_events.21.a: "The Pope is our only hope"
 shinto_events.21.b: "Send a petition ourselves"
 shinto_events.22.t: "Caliphal Authority Triumphs"
 shinto_events.22.d: "The Caliphs persistence in persecuting the Holy Church of the East has led to widespread dejection among the Nestorian peoples. Many have turned to Rome as a beacon of Christian power in the face of the great Islamic Empire, and hope we can be more cooperative with the Holy Father in the future."
 shinto_events.22.a: "So it goes"
 shinto_events.23.t: "An Uneasy Truce"
 shinto_events.23.d: "The conflict between the Caliphs and local Nestorians has come to something of a stalemate. We have not been able to convince the Caliphs to give up their attempts to control and legislate our people, but the Caliphs are cautious to attempt any more persecutions due to the fear of an outright revolution sponsored by our state church. It is unsure whether this should be counted as a loss or victory."
 shinto_events.23.a: "A victory"
 shinto_events.24.t: "Caliphs Rebuked"
 shinto_events.24.d: "The arrogant Caliphs have found widespread condemnation and civic disobedience as a result of their attempts to persecute the faithful. Without the military power to truly exert their authority in Nestorian lands, they have been forced to back down on all their pretensions and restore the sovereignty of the Church of the East."
 shinto_events.24.a: "Thank Christ"
 shinto_events.25.t: "Silk Road Trade"
 shinto_events.25.d: "For millennia the Silk Road has provided trade opportunities between the Western and Eastern worlds, and facilitated the exchange of cultures and traditions. While it has been a great instrument for the dissemination of Nestorian theology throughout Central Asia and even China, it also means strange traditions from these lands can reach our people as well. The Roman Emperors were extremely wary of the power foreign religions like Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism had over their subjects and frequently tried to quash and ban them."
 shinto_events.25.a: "Restrict foreign trade"
 shinto_events.25.b: "Leave things alone"
 shinto_events.25.c: "Promote foreign trade"
 shinto_events.26.t: "Saint Thomas Church"
 shinto_events.26.d: "Traders from India have brought word of the strangest thing - a massive Nestorian Christian community in the southern coasts of their country which was allegedly founded by Saint Thomas himself when he evangelized in those areas. They have remained largely out of contact with the central Church of the East Patriarchal structure, but if we could foster greater connections we could bring them into the fold with us.\nSome local traders are standing by, waiting for our word whether they should seek out this mysterious community of Indian Christians."
 shinto_events.26.a: "Sounds dubious"
 shinto_events.26.b: "Wait for more information"
 shinto_events.26.c: "We must welcome them"
 shinto_events.27.t: "Indian Envoy"
 shinto_events.27.d: "It turns out the stories of Saint Thomas' church were correct. A Raja from the Malabar coast of India has arrived in person at the Patriarchal palace, attesting his Christian orthodoxy and asking for the Patriarch's blessing. With him are several Indian bishops who seek official ordination from our Patriarch, and a variety of scribes who will work on establishing a common creed across our communities."
 shinto_events.27.a: "Send them away"
 shinto_events.27.b: "Wonderful"
 shinto_events.28.t: "Traders Injured"
 shinto_events.28.d: "An incident occurred in one of our main cities a few weeks ago in which some Silk Road traders from Central Asia were involved in a brawl. The local magistrate ignored their plight and refused to entertain any of their pleas for a criminal investigation or justice. Word has spread quickly, and it seems the traders have already told their compatriots about our realm's hostility to foreigners.\nIf the story of this scandal continues to spread, it could undermine the confidences of foreign investors who prop up much of our local economy, and leave the realm in isolated disgrace under the weight of boycotts and fear. What should be done to remedy the situation?"
 shinto_events.28.a: "We don't need their money"
 shinto_events.28.b: "Remove the magistrate and apologize"
 shinto_events.29.t: "The Church Remains Pure"
 shinto_events.29.d: "Our continued rejection of overtures to debase the Holy Church of the East with strange foreign customs and heretical communities has preserved our status as a truly Western body. We may be called the Church of the East, but the Mediterranean is the heart of the Christian world, not the Indian Ocean!"
 shinto_events.29.a: "Good developments"
 shinto_events.30.t: "Times Are Changing"
 shinto_events.30.d: "Though we have been cautious about accepting the role of stewards of a pan-Asian church, some degree of unity between disparate Eastern Christian traditions has been achieved. Bringing so many new people into the fold of Mesopotamia, even if their beliefs aren't quite orthodox, has been a great victory."
 shinto_events.30.a: "We must accept things"
 shinto_events.31.t: "Eastern At Heart"
 shinto_events.31.d: "With the Saint Thomas Christians now brought into communion with the Nestorian Patriarch, and believes from Beijing to Khwarezm professing allegiance to our church, the Church of the East is stronger and more Oriental than ever. At last we have truly lived up to our name."
 shinto_events.31.a: "Let them all convert!"
 shinto_events.32.t: "Nestorian Mongols"
 shinto_events.32.d: "For many in Europe and the Near East, the arrival of the Mongol Hordes was a cataclysmic event that resulted in the complete destruction of cities and entire empires. For the Church of the East, however, it was the greatest of boons, as many Mongol Khans came to accept and practice the faith, including the legendary Ilkhan Hülegü, who famously sacked Baghdad and trampled the Sunni Caliph to death inside a carpet, effectively destroying all remaining Caliphal power.\nThe Mongols have thus effected an explosion in the popularity of the Church of the East across the world, turning it into the most widely practiced Christian sect."
 shinto_events.32.a: "The East will be our cradle"
 shinto_events.32.b: "We must remember our Western roots"
 shinto_events.33.t: "Tengri Syncretism"
 shinto_events.33.d: "It has come to the attention of Church officials that some Mongol Khans who profess to follow the Nestorian creed are in fact practicing it in tandem with bizarre pagan and traditional belief systems borne out of their native Mongolia. We must decide whether to excommunicate them for their practices or teleologically accept this syncretic style of worship."
 shinto_events.33.a: "Excommunicate them!"
 shinto_events.33.b: "We can't afford to lose them"
 shinto_events.34.t: "Rising Popularity of Islam"
 shinto_events.34.d: "The Mongols are increasingly turning towards Islam, which they once considered a foreign barbarism and sought to destroy. It would be a travesty for the Church of the East if they abandoned our patronage and instead worshipped the unholy trinity of Allah, Baphomet, and Termagant!\nOur most skilled preachers may be able to coax the Mongols away from this gravely mistaken path and restore the supremacy of the Church of the East as sovereign of all Asia."
 shinto_events.34.a: "Let it go"
 shinto_events.34.b: "Use any means to convince them"
 shinto_events.35.t: "Mongols Slip Away"
 shinto_events.35.d: "Between their love of pagan traditions and Islamic heathenry, most now view the Mongols as a lost cause when it comes to the long-term survival of the Church of the East. Instead, turning back toward Rome may be our best bet in keeping the Christian faith strong in the Near East."
 shinto_events.35.a: "So be it"
 shinto_events.36.t: "Mongol Piety Wanes"
 shinto_events.36.d: "Though their have not completely abandoned the true faith, the nobility that rules within the Mongol states is not as fervent in their support for the Church of the East as they once were. This is a problem, but it is one that we can overcome if we are tenacious enough. For now, we must move on."
 shinto_events.36.a: "Sad!"
 shinto_events.37.t: "Mongol Support Cemented"
 shinto_events.37.d: "The nobility of the Khans, through our accommodation and diplomatic maneuvering, remains as sympathetic to the Church of the East as ever. We thus maintain profound institutional power and support in the Asian continent, without needing to rely on foreign agents like the Bishops of Constantinople and Rome."
 shinto_events.37.a: "A triumph"
 shinto_events.38.t: "The Cult of Mary"
 shinto_events.38.d: "The Virgin Mary, mother of God, has become hugely influential in the Western Catholic Church. Mary is venerated everywhere, and every cathedral city is marked by an 'Our Lady' or 'Notre Dame' church. Extensive theological debates have occurred over the immaculate conception, the annunciation, the ensoulment and embodiment of Christ, the act of birth, et cetera. This treatment of Mary as a supreme intercessory being - the Queen of Heaven itself - has started to spread even to our Nestorian lands among certain classes of people."
 shinto_events.38.a: "Welcome the change"
 shinto_events.38.b: "Issue no comment"
 shinto_events.38.c: "This is heresy!"
 shinto_events.39.t: "No Other God Before Me"
 shinto_events.39.d: "The popularity of Marian worship has caused a significant reactionary movement within the Church of the East, who decry it as a form of apotheosis in which Mary has taken on the role of a Goddess. To them, this Marian veneration goes against the very core tenets of the Eastern Church and is a pathetic bit of cultural imperialism from Rome that must be combatted on all fronts."
 shinto_events.39.a: "They have a point"
 shinto_events.39.b: "Let them complain"
 shinto_events.39.c: "Silence them"
 shinto_events.40.t: "A Papal Envoy"
 shinto_events.40.d: "The Pope of Rome has sent an envoy to us to celebrate the Feast of Mary. His Holiness is pleased that Marian devotion is taking off within our lands, and hopes it will lead to further cooperation between our two churches in the future. The anti-Marian majority, however, are angry at the envoy's presence and demand he be banished from the capital at once.\nThese angry factions threaten to banish him themselves, in no gentle manner, if we do not cave to their demands."
 shinto_events.40.a: "Make him return to Rome"
 shinto_events.40.b: "He should stay"
 shinto_events.41.t: "Ave Maria"
 shinto_events.41.d: "A certain Syriac composer has developed a song in Aramaic celebrating the Holy Virgin that has become popular amongst the lower classes. The song is praised for its sublime gentleness and emotional potency, and it was reported that even Muslims were moved to tears at this ode to Isa's mother Mariyya.\nPotentially, this song could be integrated into the Eastern cultural tradition and be permitted at Mass."
 shinto_events.41.a: "Unthinkable"
 shinto_events.41.b: "It should ring in every hall"
 shinto_events.45.t: "Mob Violence"
 shinto_events.45.d: "A Marian ceremony in a certain village prompted a scuffle when an angry mob, disapproving of the practice, attempted to put an end to it. This has caused extensive property damage in the village and has greatly alienated the local community of Catholics."
 shinto_events.45.a: "Denounce it"
 shinto_events.45.b: "Who cares?"
 shinto_events.47.t: "Marian Cult Triumphs"
 shinto_events.47.d: "By supporting this wonderful innovation in church practice, the Marian tradition of Western Christianity has been brought to the Church of the East as well. We can all share in the mercy and kindness of Christ's mother, whose passion nearly matched that of Christ himself on the cross.\n\nHail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee..."
 shinto_events.47.a: "Blessed art thou amongst women"
 shinto_events.48.t: "Marian Fervor Has Passed"
 shinto_events.48.d: "By carefully balancing our position between the pro-Marian factions and anti-Marian factions, we have managed to survive this conflict without alienating either side. The veneration of Mary has died down a bit, allowing most people to forget about the whole controversy and go back to life as usual."
 shinto_events.48.a: "Enlightened centrism prevails"
 shinto_events.49.t: "Marian Cult Erased"
 shinto_events.49.d: "By cracking down on this heretical and blasphemous deification of Mary that has weaseled its way into our realm from the Franks, we have preserved the orthodoxy and unity of the Church of the East free from vile foreign influences. God will surely reward us for not giving in to these temptations."
 shinto_events.49.a: "Crush all memory of it"
 shinto_events.50.t: "Iconoclasm"
 shinto_events.50.d: "A copy of the Peshitta, the Syriac Bible used by the Church of the East, was publicly burned recently because it was filled with iconographic motifs and illuminations. The rabble that burned it cited a trusted local cleric who claimed that the veneration of images runs contrary to the Holy Commandments and is tantamount to idolatry.\nThis incident is part of a string of increasingly severe iconoclastic riots across the Nestorian world, which seek to move away from the Icon and Veneration based worship so core to the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions."
 shinto_events.50.a: "They are indeed right"
 shinto_events.50.b: "Give a slap on the wrist"
 shinto_events.50.c: "Why not burn the cleric?"
 shinto_events.51.t: "Islamic Legal Influences"
 shinto_events.51.d: "Much of the iconoclastic fury in Nestorian culture can be attributed to the profound influence Islamic civilizations and cultures have had on our people. Promoting iconoclasm, and indeed banning the use of figural images outright, can be taken as a move away from the sphere of the West and towards the sphere of the Islamic world.\nSome would consider that a betrayal of our identity, but many see it as a practical unity with our true ethnic brothers and sister."
 shinto_events.51.a: "Oh save them, Rome!"
 shinto_events.51.b: "Ban it"
 shinto_events.52.t: "The Church of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 shinto_events.52.d: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is home to one of the most beautiful churches in all the Nestorian world. The nave is decorated with extensive ancient frescos showing the evangelists, Christ, and many stories from the Old and New Testaments. Travelers come from around the world just to lay eyes upon its incredible artwork and miraculous icons.\nIconoclasts, however, are having none of this. They demand that the church's art be covered up with plaster in favor of a plain design that matches the humility and simplicity of Christ and his apostles. To bow to their demands would not only ruin this great art, but also wrack up a considerable renovation cost."
 shinto_events.52.a: "There is no price on salvation"
 shinto_events.52.b: "Ignore them"
 shinto_events.55.t: "End of Iconoclasm"
 shinto_events.55.d: "We have remained true to the traditions of other Eastern Christians and to the Roman Pope by crushing these fanatical vandals who sought to destroy all the beautiful art and icons that make our church so prestigious. The Holy Father will be extremely pleased to hear of the result of this controversy."
 shinto_events.55.a: "Pray to the Pantokrator"
 shinto_events.56.t: "Compromise Reached"
 shinto_events.56.d: "Neither the iconophilic or iconoclastic factions have received unconditional support from our state, and thus the two parties have been forced to come to certain compromises over the veneration of icons and other images. We have preserved the Church of the East in something of state of status quo."
 shinto_events.56.a: "Caution pays off"
 shinto_events.57.t: "End of Icon Worship"
 shinto_events.57.d: "By supporting new laws in our realm criminalizing the worship and veneration of icons and other graven images, we have moved the Church of the East toward a new iconoclastic standard that puts it in total contrast to other Eastern churches and even the Catholics of Rome."
 shinto_events.57.a: "Idolatry is finally gone"
#Inti Kemetic Events
 inti_events.1.t: "$RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$'s Mummification"
 inti_events.1.d: "With the funeral of $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ his transition through mummification begins. Once the funeral rites have been observed $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ will likely be sent into a comfortable afterlife. In return, the deceased ruler is expected to support and help his living family. His property and authority will remain what it was during his life and the mummy will continue to be a venerable idol within our realm.\nNot all rulers are fit for mummification however, there are some we would rather forget."
 inti_events.1.a: "$RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ will be fully mummified."
 inti_events.1.b: "This is no longer a ruler, it is a powerful spirit, an idol."
 inti_events.2.d: "The priests of Osiris have made it clear that [Root.Heir.GetName] must take his sister as his primary wife to please the gods. Many of his ancestors and even the god of fertility himself have married this way within the family and kept the bloodline pure. The boy's mother, however, refuses to hear of this and will not give her consent.\nThe proper way to solve this schism would be to ask our ancestor, the mummy of an ancestor who possessed tremendous wisdom during his lifetime for guidance."
 inti_events.3.t: "Oracle Approval"
 inti_events.3.d: "Through the priests of Osiris, the mummy of one of the wisest of our ancestors has made it known that he approves of the proposed marriage. As his authority is crucial there is really no way now for anyone to object to the proposed marriage of [Root.Heir.GetName] to his sister."
 inti_events.4.t: "Oracle Disapproval"
 inti_events.4.d: "Through the priests of Osiris, the mummy of one of the wisest of our ancestors has made it known that he does not approve of the proposed marriage. As his authority is crucial there is really no way now to carry through with the marriage."
 inti_events.5.d: "Our religious inspector has uncovered a conspiracy where one of the minor chiefs of the realm has been conspiring against the health of [Root.Monarch.GetName] through worshipping hideous chaos gods.\nWhile it is doubtful if there was ever any real risk for [Root.Monarch.GetName] the inspector is proposing that we make an example of this chief, and proclaim him the worst kind of traitor as well as forcibly removing everyone who was involved."
 inti_events.5.a: "Removing all religious icons is enough."
 inti_events.5.b: "This Chief will face the stake."
 inti_events.6.t: "Veneration of Local Deities"
 inti_events.6.d: "A ruler is expected to travel around his kingdom, inspecting each and every part of his realm and partaking in the religious as well as worldly ceremonies of his chiefs. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches the huge temple of a local god, the royal priests urge caution. This is an unusually popular god and if we are seen to honor the gods of our subjects too clearly we would be giving them too much power and authority.\nOn the other hand this god is said to be very powerful and its popularity along with the favors it might provide are very enticing."
 inti_events.6.a: "Honor the God."
 inti_events.6.c: "Force the chief to destroy the Temple."
 inti_events.8.t: "Temple of Memphis"
 inti_events.8.d: "As the father of the gods, from whom all life emanates, Ptah is revered as one of the most powerful creator gods. As the creator of the cosmos, he first created himself and then formed mankind from clay and a potter's wheel.\nIn Ancient Egypt, a magnificent temple complex adorned the royal residence of Memphis, of which only ruins remain today. To praise Prah, we should restore the splendor of the former temple."
 inti_events.9.t: "Priestly Confessors"
 inti_events.9.d: "After a recent war guilt lies like a heavy blanket over our people. It is time to give them the opportunity to purify themselves from the sins they have had to commit in times of war. Our priests have signaled that this would be an opportune time to hold a festival of purification and fasting so that anyone could confess to the priesthood and be cleansed in the streams of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.10.d: "Word has reached us that a local chief in [Root.GetName] has begun to construct an ambitious new temple for a local god of his tribe. While the chief seems content to acknowledge our authority it is hard to shake the notion that he is attempting to build a bigger power base for himself in [Root.GetName].\nThe priests of Ra in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] strongly advocate that we forbid the construction to put this chief in his place."
 inti_events.10.a: "Order the chief to cancel the construction."
 inti_events.12.d: "Without oases and streams life in the deserts would be much harder and the spirits that animate the running water are certainly worthy of our appreciation. The time has come for a festival to honour the Nile. The fertile oases of Egypt are ready to receive our gifts."
 inti_events.12.a: "A sacrifice of tasty Beer to drink."
 inti_events.12.b: "A sacrifice of Oxen to ease their burdens."
 inti_events.12.c: "A sacrifice of fine Cloth to protect them from the heat."
 inti_events.13.d: "The people of the province of [Root.GetName] are divided and worship various local Gods. It has therefore been decided that a great temple of Ra should be constructed here as a natural centre for the spiritual and administrative life of the region.\nThe leader of the construction has presented [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] with two different plans for the temple. The first plan is to construct the temple at a Holy Site while the other plan calls for making use of an old shrine as the base of the new temple."
 inti_events.13.a: "A new temple needs a new location, the Holy Site it is."
 inti_events.14.d: "The world can sometimes be an unforgiving place and fate may turn in surprising ways. Luckily we have the Gods of our people to help us interpret what the future holds. Should the future be too hard for the Gods to penetrate there are other oracles in our realm, but they require a worthy gift before sharing their visions. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been beset by ample doubts recently and it is perhaps time to consult the auguries."
 inti_events.14.a: "Consult the local oracle at [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.14.b: "Travel to the great Oracle of Behdet."
 inti_events.14.c: "We must go to the Oracle of Thebes."
 inti_events.15.t: "Favorable answer from the Oracle"
 inti_events.15.d: "A great number of diviners are attached to any given Oracle's shrine. After [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked the Oracle for its knowledge the priests are interpreting the behavior of sacred animals. Other priests are drawing lots and consulting statues through which a priest apparently speaks creating a prophetic mood.\nAll of these great diviners have now dwelt on the questions [Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to pose and all agree that the time ahead will be a most fruitful and successful one."
 inti_events.16.t: "Conflicted answer of the Oracle"
 inti_events.16.d: "A great number of diviners are attached to any given Oracle's shrine. After [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked the Oracle for its knowledge the priests are interpreting the behavior of sacred animals. Other priests are drawing lots and consulting statues through which a priest apparently speaks creating a prophetic mood.\nAll of these great diviners have now dwelt on the questions [Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to pose but the answer is not as favorable as he would have hoped. The signs are conflicted and as far as can be discerned the future holds both risks and opportunities for us."
 inti_events.17.t: "Outcasts Wanting to Go Home"
 inti_events.17.d: "With the conquest of new lands we have come across groups of people that have been forcibly moved as outcasts from one region to another by their former overlords. As outcasts are not allowed to change the way they speak, the clothes they wear and have to take all their property with them, these people have never stopped to yearn for their original homes.\nAs it happens their area of origin is also under our control and a delegation from the outcasts has therefore been sent before [Root.Monarch.GetName] claiming that their Gods have told them to return, begging us to lift their obligations."
 inti_events.17.a: "Allow the outcasts to return."
 inti_events.18.d: "The priests of a local god in [Root.GetName] have been trying to inflame opinions against our rule by saying that we are slowly attempting to increase the authority of Ra and marginalize that of all the syncretic Gods. Luckily most of our subjects know better than to listen to these wild accusations but one of [Root.GetName]'s tribes supports the priests and have now demanded that we give them guarantees for the safety of their Gods and their people."
 inti_events.18.a: "The time has come for these people to move on."
 inti_events.18.c: "These priests are only fit for the stake."
 inti_events.20.t: "Heb-Sed, the Festival of the Tail"
 inti_events.20.d: "The supreme priests, in charge of piety in the entire country, have proclaimed that the most opportune time to celebrate the Heb-Seb festival is almost upon us. The festival which lasts several days typically involves the entire population of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as well as important chiefs from the countryside to renew the rule of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 inti_events.20.c: "All chiefs and all priests must attend the ceremony."
 inti_events.21.d: "Some of the chiefs that have been called have taken offense to being ordered around and have refused to join the Heb-Sed festival."
 inti_events.22.t: "Priests Kept"
 inti_events.22.d: "Priests in charge of local Gods have taken offense to come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and are refusing to come."
 inti_events.23.t: "Invitation to the festival of Heb-Sed"
 inti_events.23.d: "A messenger has arrived from [From.GetName] demanding our presence at the festival of Heb-Sed in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.23.a: "Then we must go to celebrate the [From.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 inti_events.23.b: "Let's stay home and honor our own [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 inti_events.24.d: "[From.Monarch.GetName], the ruler of [From.GetName] has declined our invitation to join in the celebration of Heb-Sed."
 inti_events.25.t: "Celebration of Heb-Sed"
 inti_events.25.d: "After several days of fasting and abstinence the time has come for the festival of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. As the population of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] prepare for the grand ceremonies in which [Root.Monarch.GetName] is greeted and animals sacrificed they also know that several days of feasting are ahead of them."
 inti_events.26.t: "Celebration of Heb-Sed"
 inti_events.26.d: "After several days of fasting and abstinence the time has come for the festival of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Squares of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] are filled to their brim as the ceremonies to greet [Root.Monarch.GetName] begin and animals and other gifts are sacrificed by the people of our [Root.GovernmentName] and the many chiefs under our rule. Several days of feasting and gifts given by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to his subjects now await."
 inti_events.27.t: "Celebration of Heb-Sed"
 inti_events.27.d: "After several days of fasting and abstinence the time has come for the festival of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Squares of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] are filled to their brim as the ceremonies to greet [Root.Monarch.GetName] begin and animals and other gifts are sacrificed by the people of our [Root.GovernmentName] and the many chiefs under our rule. Several days of feasting and gifts given by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to his subjects now await."
 inti_events.29.t: "Feast of the Valley"
 inti_events.29.d: "There is great distress in our lands. People are suffering and many fear for the future. In times like these an Wadi celebration for the entire kingdom might lighten the minds of our subjects. The sacrifices it entails will also make the Gods more listen to our plights.\nFor this festival our priests are urging that we undertake a human sacrifice as the plight of our people have been great and they feel a grand ceremony is necessary to placate the gods."
 inti_events.29.a.tt: "Hold a customary festival with sacrifices of Cloth, Bread, Oxen and Sheep."
 inti_events.29.b.tt: "Hold a larger and longer festival culminating in the sacrifice of Humans."
 inti_events.30.t: "Wadi Celebration"
 inti_events.30.d: "After days of celebration the future certainly looks brighter. Grand ceremonial dancing ceremonies in the public squares of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], feasts for all vassal chiefs and ample sacrifices of animals, vegetables and cloth to the gods will ensure that the Gods look more favorably on our realm in the future."
 inti_events.31.t: "Wadi Celebration"
 inti_events.31.d: "After days of celebrations, public feasting, ceremonial dancing and both initiated and ended with the sacrifice of the most perfect humans our lands could bring forth, we feel confident we will face a brighter future."
 inti_events.32.t: "The Medjay"
 inti_events.32.d: "The honor to guard the life of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is prestigious and belongs to a number of men in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]. This honor is in itself not a guarantee of martial prowess however. After a tour in the provinces it is clear to [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the quality of the guard could be dramatically improved if we brought in some new blood from the countryside.\nThis would, however, not be well received by the men currently given the privilege, at least not until the new members have been integrated for the next time."
 inti_events.33.t: "Alarmed Warrior Caste"
 inti_events.33.d: "A delegation from some of the best warriors in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] demanding that the new members of the Medjay be sent back to their homes in the provinces. While they are pleased that the institution as such was not changed they are abhorred by the kind of people that now have the prestigious right to guard the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. These men are not fit to be part of the bold warrior caste of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.34.d: "During the customary serving of beverages to the commoners from around the royal litter in the squares of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] today [Root.Monarch.GetName] was attacked by a small group of would-be assassins. The group suddenly retreated without being anywhere near achieving the goal of hurting [Root.Monarch.GetName], but it was worryingly clear that the Medjay never saw this coming. Perhaps because they are not yet used to the bustling environment of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.36.d: "The investigation into the attack in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has uncovered an amateurish plot by a group of young men that felt marginalized in the Medjay. They claim that the attack was never intended to harm anyone, just point towards the weaknesses of the new additions to the guard. The punishment for treason is clearly death but the families of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] would clearly not feel any less threatened if we killed their sons. If we forgive them the transgression perhaps that will be the end of this."
 inti_events.36.a: "To the lion cages!"
 inti_events.36.b: "Forgive the men."
#Nahuatl Uatsdin events
 nahuatl_events.1.d: "After intense study of the skies and the relevant calendars our priests agree that everything indicates that harsh and troubling times are ahead. As commoners and nobles alike prepare for what is to come many will attempt to save themselves from the bad times by sacrificing some of their food and cattle."
 nahuatl_events.1.a: "Organize a royal sacrificial ceremony."

 nahuatl_events.5.d: "Despite the very favorable omens it seems the young warrior born all those years ago has been captured by the enemy. If he does not die in the dungeon, he will soon face his destiny at the scaffold or be sold to slavery. While this is an honorable end the disappointment of his house is great."
 nahuatl_events.6.t: "Defeated Warrior"
 nahuatl_events.6.d: "Despite the favorable omens the young warrior born all those years ago has been slain in the field of battle. He will never become a great warrior now, nor will he bring [Root.GetName] glory and honor ever."
 nahuatl_events.7.t: "Incompetent Warrior"
 nahuatl_events.7.d: "Despite the very favorable omens the young boy born all those years ago has proved to be a disappointment to himself and his house. In the face of battle he has proven a coward, staying back and failing to make a single capture despite having multiple opportunities to do so. Upon his return to [Root.GetName] he will forever be known as a failed warrior."
 nahuatl_events.10.t: "Incident during Uastyrdzhi Festival"
 nahuatl_events.10.d: "A noble of one of our most prominent families was found drunk in the street today. Not only is this a terrible affront to the gods, punishable by flogging, but it happened during the time of Uastyrdzhi Festival when all disturbances of the peace are strictly forbidden."
 nahuatl_events.10.a: "Punish him."
 nahuatl_events.11.d: "We have received word from one of our provinces that a man claiming to have magical powers is spreading fear and evil rumors there. The Elders are confident that this is a mere charlatan that they can handle but many commoners are susceptible to his influence."
 nahuatl_events.11.b: "Let the Elders deal with him."
 nahuatl_events.13.d: "The sorcerer spreading fear in our lands has been caught. The traditional punishment for a man like him would be to cast out evil spirits from him, robbing him of his magical powers. As this man has managed to cause much more harm than the average countryside conjurer, however, perhaps it would be better to punish him by death immediately to placate gods and men alike."
 nahuatl_events.13.a: "Summon the exorcist!"
 nahuatl_events.14.t: "Evil Spirits"
 nahuatl_events.14.d: "News has reached us that the punishment of the sorcerer who caused so much unrest in our lands did not go exactly as planned. None of this involved remain to tell the tale but the rumor that has been spreading is that the man was an evil spirit and that an owl was seen leaving his cell. Regardless of if he did turn into an owl or not, the whole incident has caused wild rumors to spread all around our country."
 nahuatl_events.15.d: "It seems the sorcerer that got away from us once has now returned. The Elders insist the man has been spreading diseases and making ill-boding predictions and must be stopped."
 nahuatl_events.15.b: "Let the Elders deal with him."
 nahuatl_events.16.t: "Wrathful Gods"
 nahuatl_events.16.d: "A great disaster has befallen us. This morning $HEIR$ was missing. One of the child's servants insists that the perpetrator was a spirit bearing resemblance to a woman that died giving birth nearby recently. That such a dark creature would be able to spirit away our heir in the middle of the night is surely a sign that we have infuriated the gods."
 nahuatl_events.16.a: "We must do what we can to placate Barastyr."
 nahuatl_events.17.d: "$MONARCH$ has taken ill and has a rising fever. The doctors in attendance have recommended a number of infusions from roots and herbs."
 nahuatl_events.26.t: "Merchant Spies"
 nahuatl_events.26.d: "The rich merchant trade guilds are essential to the trade network of the Caucasian and their members are generally free to cross our borders as they please. This unreserved welcoming has, however, evidently been exploited by our rivals as a number of traders now stand accused of espionage on their behalf."
 nahuatl_events.27.t: "Traders Harassed"
 nahuatl_events.27.d: "The trade guilds based in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have come to us asking that we punish [From.GetName] for harassing their members. Apparently the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] claims that the merchants have been spying on our behalf and has used this as an excuse to confiscate their goods."
 nahuatl_events.28.d: "The spoken word has always had a special significance to our people, songs and recitations feature prominently in all our religious and profane ceremonies and even our highest leaders are referred to as venerable idols. Oral poetry is therefore one of the most sacred forms of art and one of few accepted ways in which a person can express dissatisfaction, anxiety and even doubt about fate itself without angering the gods.\nRecently an immensely popular Ætsægdin poet has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], praising our city and its people but criticizing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]."
 nahuatl_events.29.d: "The main temple of our capital is the primary symbol of our rule and the bond we have with the gods. It is where all of the main sacrifices will be made during the many festivals of the year and it is the main target for any invading enemy. For a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is a duty to maintain and expand the temple whenever possible."
 nahuatl_events.29.a: "Undertake an ambitious expansion of the temple."
 nahuatl_events.29.b: "Time to renovate the temple."
 nahuatl_events.31.d: "Each and every citizen of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] awoke at once this morning as a powerful earthquake shook the entire city, destroying several buildings and even some of the temples. To the great relief of commoner and noble alike, however, the city and most of its inhabitants remain unharmed.\nWe must thank the gods that have helped us keep this world alive for sparing us today."

The four bronze horses adorning the Hippodrome were stolen, as well as the Mandylion, a sacred icon. Countless other objects of value were either melted down or taken back to Western Europe. However, the resulting carnage at the hands of the Crusaders was to be even more shocking still. Nothing and no one was spared in their rampage which desecrated Hagia Sophia and massacred thousands within the city.\nThe glory of Constantinople has been effectively erased, and in its absence a power vacuum has swept through the region, providing fertile ground for the Crusaders to establish independent Latin kingdoms on what were once Greek lands.

We have received word that this rebellion was fomented by agents of the Scandinavians, who wish to see England returned to their control at any cost.

After being restored to the English throne, Eadweard was more concerned with piety than royal duties, and resented his powerful vassals - especially the ambitious Godwin family who held Earldoms in Wessex, East Anglia, and Northumbria. On this basis, he promised that upon his death the English crown would pass to his magnanimous cousin Guillaume de Normandie. \nThe day has finally come.

 HREMA26: "Let the ducats flow!"
 HREMT27: "Expansion of New World Trade"
 HREMD27: "By now massive swathes of the serene American landscape have been annexed by European powers for their colonial ventures. As naval technology grows ever more advanced, the opportunities for trade profit have increased accordingly."
 HREMA27: "Let the ducats flow!"
 HREMT28: "Expansion of New World Trade"
 HREMD28: "The economic power of these New World possessions has utterly changed the face of Europe. We now have more money than ever before flowing into our ports from across the ocean."
 HREMA28: "Let the ducats flow!"
 HREMT29: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Succession"
 HREMD29: "The passing of our late monarch has raised questions over the rightful heir to the throne. The English claim the closest male relative is actually their own King, but this connection only works by passing through a female intermediary, which our nobility counters is against crown laws. While we have crowned a [Root.GetAdjective] successor, the English could use this as a pretext to invade our nation."
 HREMA29: "Let us hope they don't press the claim..."
 HREMT30: "Claims to [From.GetName]"
 HREMD30: "The passing of the late King of the Franks has raised questions over the rightful heir to the throne. They have crowned a [From.GetAdjective] pretender, but the the closest male relative is actually [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The [From.GetAdjective] nobility has tried to object to our rightful inheritance by claiming the crown cannot pass through a female intermediary, but we can use this as a justification for invasion regardless."
 HREMA30: "We will fight for a century!"
 HREMB30: "There is no sense in pursuing it"
 HREMT31: "Hundred Years' War Victory"
 HREMD31: "The triumph of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] over the pretenders who sought to steal [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rightfully inherited throne has brought a great excitement to the country, as parades march through [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] displaying the spoils of our hard-fought war. At last, peasants and nobles alike can put away their arms and the state can be shifted away from a total war economy to the management of our newly won titles."
 HREMA31: "For [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and Country!"
 HREMT32: "End of the Hundred Years' War"
 HREMD32: "The extinction of the title for which we have so long fought brings with it the extinction of the great war's raison d'être. For now, peasants and nobles alike can put away their arms and the state can be shifted away from a total war ecnonomy to the management of our extant titles."

One of our top advisors has warned the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] about the issue and formulated a plan to combat these illegitimate sources. He requests the immediate implementation of the new statutes."

 HREMB38: "Don't be rude!"
 HREMC38: "YOU are fake news!"
 HREMT39: "Rosicrucians"
 HREMD39: "Legend holds that a wise doctor by the name Christian Rosenkreuz discovered certain ancient and esoteric secrets about the earth while studying deep in Islamic territory under the guidance of Sufi mystics.\nAt least, [Root.Monarch.GetName] always thought it was a mere legend... until this strange hooded mendicant showed up in his court demanding an audience. The man explained he was a representative of the secret Rosicrucian fraternal order founded by Rosenkreuz himself, and that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was to be given an opportunity to prove his worth and join as one of the order's eight grandmasters.\nThe mysterious visitor insists the order must be kept a secret or great misfortunes will befall the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and further explains that joining the order demands an oath of bachelordom. The trials of entry may be quite costly, but the rewards - hidden knowledge unthinkable to the general public - will be great."
 HREMA39: "We have no time for such hoaxes"
 HREMB39: "Please, tell me more!"
 HREMT40: "The Test"
 HREMD40: "The hooded mystic has agreed to test [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s mettle in the occult arts of alchemy and holistic medicine. Leading the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to a hidden chamber filled with bubbling elixirs and the desiccated corpses of fantastic beasts, he simply points a gnarled finger at the most dangerous looking potions without speaking a word."
 HREMA40: "Let's hope this doesn't explode..."
 HREMB40: "An easy task"
 HREMT41: "Success!"
 HREMD41: "Sweat dripping onto the table, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to stabilize the volatile panacea in the nick of time before disaster. The hooded onlooker smiles a grin of rotted teeth and reveals a red crucifix necklace from some hidden pocket in his robes. He beckons for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to bear the new symbol of his esoteric lineage."
 HREMA41: "For Rosenkreuz!"
 HREMB41: "I feel... younger"
 HREMT42: "Oath Betrayed"
 HREMD42: "By joining the most sacred and secret Rosicrucian order, we took an oath to be a lifelong bachelor. With our late marriage, the oath has been broken, and the Order is ready to excommunicate us for this outrageous transgression against its rules."
 HREMA42: "Beg the Order for forgiveness"
 HREMB42: "Goodbye [Root.Consort.GetName]"
 HREMT43: "Rosicrucian Secrets"

 HREMA43: "Clairvoyance"
 HREMB43: "Draft of silver tongues"
 HREMC43: "Martial manna"
 HREMT44: "Rosicrucian Refugee"
 HREMD44: "A Rosicrucian practitioner has been driven from their homeland by chaotic instability. Knowing our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to be one of the eight followers of Rosenkreuz, they have appealed to our court for protection, offering to share their personal occult secrets and earn their place within the realm."
 HREMA44: "Great"
 HREMB44: "Let them find someone else"
 HREMT45: "A Shared Secret"
 HREMD45: "While our nations act in their own interests in most matters, a great secret held by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the knowledge that our neighboring head of state is also a member of the Rosicrucian order. Though we may meet on the battlefield, there will always be a hidden respect between us."
 HREMA45: "For Rozenkreuz"
 HREMT46: "Order Requests Assistance"
 HREMD46: "Our position as a member of the eight Rosicrucian masters has afforded us many benefits, but it also involves obligations. The order needs our assistance now, but in the interest of secrecy they cannot tell us what exactly they need our help for in the first place."
 HREMA46: "Very well"
 HREMT47: "Foreign Donation"
 HREMD47: "A magnanimous ruler of [From.GetName] has sent us a donation of 100 ducats to support our noble fight against the heathens and the impious Christians who wish to subjugate us."
 HREMA47: "Great"
 HREMT48: "The Sicilian Throne"
 HREMD48: "The late Friedrich II von Hohenstaufen, great Emperor that he was, left his legitimate children in control of the family's titles in Swabia and Tuscany, while the bastard Manfred received a mere administrative role in Sicily and the right of regency if an underaged ruler were to succeed. With Friedrich dead, the time has come to turn over the realm to its rightful heirs. Of course, with their powerbase being so far away from the verdant beaches of Southern Italy, it would be more than a small challenge for them to enforce their demands in the face of resistance..."
 HREMA48: "Turn over the title"
 HREMB48: "'Molon Labe', as the Greeks say"
 HREMT49: "The Sicilian Throne"
 HREMD49: "Our kinsman [From.Monarch.GetTitle] Friedrich of Sicily has regretfully died, leaving the throne vacant. His illegitimate son Manfred, previously acting as a local governor and royal administrator, has ignored our rightful agnatic claim to the throne and refused to turn over control of the realm. We must send an army down at once to claim what is ours by succession!"
 HREMA49: "War is the continuation of politics by other means..."
 HREMT50: "Sicilian Pretender!"
 HREMD50: "Friedrich II's illegitimate son Manfred has so far been a talented administrator to our Kingdom, having handed it over as promised upon the death of the good Emperor. We have just learned, however, that a false report of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s death has spurred Manfred to crown himself King of Sicily in our stead! We must divert troops immediately to reclaim the title."
 HREMA50: "He will pay for his treachery"
 HREMT51: "Abbasids Desire Independence"
 HREMD51: "Centuries ago, the Abbasid line of the Prophet's descendants overthrew the Umayyad Caliphs with the promise of equality to all Muslims regardless of ethnic background. Though their Caliphate was mighty under such rulers as Harun ar-Rashid, it began to decline territorially almost immediately until, by the tenth century, the Caliphs held no authority outside southern Iraq.\nIn AD 945 the Shiite Persian Buyid dynasty assumed total control over the Caliphate's remaining lands under the title 'Amir al-Umara', and from that point on the role of the Abbasid Caliphs in Baghdad has been purely ceremonial. Now, however, the Caliphs itch for independence and call upon us to grant them the temporal power they rightfully deserve."
 HREMA51: "Grant them temporal authority"
 HREMB51: "We will never support such a state!"
 HREMT52: "A New High King?"
 HREMD52: "With the passing of the last High King, [From.GetName] continues to claim to hold overlordship across all Ireland under their new leader. In reality, the legal status of the High Kingship has been uncertain since Brian Boru usurped the title from the ancient Uí Néill sept before dying at the Battle of Clontarf. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] could very well claim the title himself if he could prove his mastery over the current pretenders by forcing them to submit to [Root.GetName] in warfare.\nIt is said that whoever can march through all of Ireland undefeated is the true High King... and [From.GetName] may not merit such a boast."
 HREMA52: "Claim the crown!"
 HREMB52: "We have no objection"
 HREMT53: "Claiming High Kingship"
 HREMD53: "Our nation has declared a war to take the High Kingship of Ireland from our enemies, who have scorned [Root.GetName] with their pretenses to that title. The High Kingship will be officially transferred when we have proven our military superiority by winning the war."
 HREMA53: "To High King [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 HREMT54: "High King [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 HREMD54: "Our war for the High Kingship of Ireland has ended in victory after the successful subjugation of the old High King's realm. By turning over hostages to [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], the act of submission and renunciation of the title was formalized. With strong leadership once again restored to Ireland, we predict many great years of prosperity ahead. Long may the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] High Kings reign!"
 HREMA54: "Sweet victory"
 HREMT55: "High Kingship Lost"
 HREMD55: "With the recent changes that have taken plane in [Root.GetName], we can no longer justify our claim to be High King of Ireland. As such, the title has passed out of our control and into the annals of history, where it may be claimed by another state or left to gather dust."
 HREMA55: "So be it"
 HREMT56: "High King Prevails"
 HREMD56: "Our war for the High Kingship of Ireland has ended in failure after the reigning High King successfully defended the title from [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]'s invasion force. Not only is our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] humiliated, but we have wasted precious resources on the botched attempt to usurp power and have alienated ourselves from the true King."
 HREMA56: "There will be another time..."
 HREMT57: "Intervention of the High King"
 HREMD57: "This ongoing war has devastated our realm and brought hard times upon our people. If it continues much longer, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s coffers will be empty and starving citizens may attempt to overthrow the state. At times like this, it is acceptable to appeal to the High King of Ireland to mediate a resolution to the dispute and re-establish peace between warring clans. Maybe, for the sake of the nation, we should invoke the High King's power."
 HREMA57: "Ask him for help"
 HREMB57: "We are not cowards!"
 hrema57.tt: "The High King will decide whether to force a White Peace"
 HREMT58: "[From.GetName] Requests Intervention"
 HREMD58: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] is locked in a losing war which has devastated the countryside and caused the deaths of numerous Irish clansmen from both sides. High King [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been asked to put his foot down and mediate a dispute between the warring parties, re-establishing peace. If we agree, [From.GetName] will be grateful but the winning side will be deeply angered that we spoiled their victory."
 HREMA58: "Intervene"
 HREMB58: "The High King is not an errand-boy"
 hrema58.tt: "A White Peace will be forced between [From.GetName] and all Irish enemies"
 HREMT59: "[From.GetName] Mediates Peace"
 HREMD59: "High King [From.Monarch.GetName] has heard our plea for help and has stepped in to ensure the lawless clans that launched unprovoked attacks on us are brought to heel. Effective immediately, peace has been established in the realm on pain of high treason. The High King has truly proven himself worthy of the title!"
 HREMA59: "Long may he reign!"
 HREMT60: "High King Forces Peace"
 HREMD60: "Apparently the cowards of [From.GetName] have gone behind our backs to demand help from the so-called High King of Ireland. This underhanded rogue should have laughed them out of his castle, but he has seen fit to step into our righteous conflict and demand that we stand down. The ancient privileges of the High King still prevail in the hearts and minds of our people, so we cannot afford to refuse his demands, but we await the day this crooked pretender's power wanes and a more fair High King can be installed!"
 HREMA60: "So be it"
 HREMT61: "Spread of Maize"
 HREMD61: "Maize has always been a traditional food of the Native Americans and was brought to Europe by Spanish explorers around 1500s. Thanks to its ability to grow in diverse climates and to be harvested in successive years in the same field, this crop spread rapidly across the continent. By the 18th century, maize was the staple food for most peasants in Western Europe.\nThe [Root.GetTradeGoodsName] farmers of [Root.GetName] have also heard of this wondrous plant and have recently begun to successfully and profitably switch their farming to maize cultivation."
 HREMA61: "This will boost our food production."
 HREMT62: "[From.GetName] Refuses Mediation"
 HREMD62: "High King [From.Monarch.GetName] has heard our plea for help and has elected to stay out of our conflict. He claims that the office of High King does not exist to serve as the errand-boy for defeated clans, and that we must bear the brunt of the unprovoked aggression against us. His arrogance will not be forgotten, and when we recover from this war we must see to it that [From.GetName] is stripped of their title!"
 HREMA62: "We are on our own"
 HREMT63: "Rome Needs an Heir"
 HREMD63: "The age of the current Byzantine [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the lack of a legitimate heir has caused concern across the [Root.GovernmentName]. Many expect [Root.Monarch.GetName] to nominate a promising young noble to be their successor, establishing the wellsprings of a new powerful dynasty to lead the state to further glory."
 HREMA63: "A Doukid noble"
 HREMB63: "A Komnenid noble"
 HREMC63: "A court favorite"
 HREMDD63: "No it doesn't"
 HREMT64: "Switzerland"
 HREMD64: "Our supreme position within the Confederacy, and the general strength of our alliance throughout the Swiss region, has allowed us to end the era of Cantons and bring on the era of a semi-unified Swiss state. No more shall foreign powers subjugate us!"
 HREMA64: "In Per Tuts!"
 HREMT65: "Metropolitan Hilarion"
 HREMD65: "Since the Christianization of the Rus, Greeks from the Byzantine Empire have occupied the office of Metropolitan of Kiev, appointed by the Patriarch of Constantinople. It was only at the request of Yaroslav the Wise in 1051 that Hilarion, the first Slavic bishop, was elected to this office by an assembly of Slavic bishops, marking a break with the old tradition.\nMany powerful Greek bishops of the Rus now fear that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] could continue this tradition of his predecessor, causing them to suspect gradual emancipation of the Russian Church. Consequently, they demand the deposition of Hilarion and the appointment of a Greek by the Patriarch of Constantinople and the promise to maintain ties with Byzantium."
 HREMA65: "The Greeks are our friends and companions"
 HREMB65: "We must strive for a detachment from the Patriarchy"
 HREMT66: "A Foothold in Persia"
 HREMD66: "Rumors have been circulating that there is unrest in Hormuz and the position of the [ORM.Monarch.GetTitle] has become tenuous. For decades we have been trying to expand our influence into the Persian Gulf to gain control over the lucrative trade from India, and this may be the perfect opportunity.\nShould we send an expeditionary force to demand the [ORM.Monarch.GetTitle] submit to us as a protectorate? It will be an offer [ORM.Monarch.GetSheHe] can't refuse."
 HREMA66: "Send an expedition"
 HREMB66: "Let them be"
 HREMT67: "Foreign Protectorate"
 HREMD67: "Representatives from Portugal have arrived in Hormuz with a large military contingent, apparently reacting to rumors that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was weak. They demand that we submit to them and become a protectorate of the Portuguese [POR.Monarch.GetTitle], and in return they will protect our trade ships and secure our autonomy versus our ambitious neighbors."
 HREMA67: "Accept the demands"
 HREMB67: "Never!"
 HREMT68: "A New Protectorate"
 HREMD68: "The [ORM.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hormuz, sensing [ORM.Monarch.GetHerHis] weakness and our overwhelming strength, has agreed to become our newest protectorate and allow Portuguese traders to oversee their economic relationships."
 HREMA68: "Wonderful"
 HREMT69: "Hormuz Refuses"
 HREMD69: "The impudent [ORM.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hormuz has refused our generous offer to take them in as a protectorate. May [ORM.Monarch.GetSheHe] look back upon this decision with regret when angry crowds overthrow the Hormuzi state and Portuguese galleys blockade their capital!"
 HREMA69: "We will take it by force!"
 HREMT70: "The White Ship Disaster"
 HREMD70: "Returning from an engagement in Normandy, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] let [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heir [Root.Heir.GetName] take a separate ship home, along with [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] sister Matilda and most of the other children of the English nobility.\nThe vessel, called La Blanche-Nef, was captained by the experienced commander Thomas FitzStephen whose father had sailed over with William the Bastard during the Norman Conquest. Before launch, however, great amounts of wine were distributed to the crew, leading to a drunken helmsman crashing the ship into a rock while navigating the channel. The ship immediately capsized.\nOnly a Norman butcher named Berold de Rouen managed to escape alive by holding onto the mast until another ship passed. He reported that [Root.Heir.GetName] could have escaped in a lifeboat but turned back to rescue Matilda and was dragged to [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] grave by hundreds of panicked passengers trying to enter the boat simultaneously. FitzStephen committed suicide out of shame.\nWith no heir and the English nobility decimated, this disaster could very well lead to dynastic anarchy..."
 HREMA70: "An ocean of grief!"
 HREMT71: "Changes to the Azeri Language"
 HREMD71: "Since the arrival of the Seljuk Turks in the eleventh century, Turkic ethnic groups have had a profound influence on the Azeri people. In recent centuries, many Azeri elites have learned Turkish as a language of international commerce and prestige, and it has had quite an effect on Azeri literature itself.\nTurkicisms, Turkish loanwords, and even Turkish grammatical conventions have worked their way throughout our language so thoroughly that it has essentially abandoned its Iranic roots and could very well become mutually intelligible with Turkish. Should we allow this process to continue or try to fight against it with strictly conservative and nativist language education?"
 HREMA71: "We welcome it"
 HREMB71: "Expunge all foreign influences!"
 HREMT72: "A Jewish Homeland"
 HREMD72: "News has reached the Jews of [Root.GetName] that a Jewish homeland has been re-established in Palestine. Many of them wish to leave our realm and return to the Promised Land."
 HREMA72: "Interesting..."
 HREMB72: "We can afford it"
 HREMC72: "By all means let them go"
 HREMT73: "Byzantium Without Byzantion"
 HREMD73: "The loss of Constantinople has been a profoundly damaging event in the identity of the Byzantine state. Having been reduced to little more than pockets of islands protected from enemies by isolation alone, it seems unfitting to even call the state the Byzantine Empire.\nThe people of Byzantium agree that they would be better off with their fellow Greeks in our state, and that the Imperial title should be resurrected only if the holy city of Constantine can be its center again."
 HREMA73: "We welcome them to the fold"
 HREMT74: "Two Designations"
 HREMD74: "The unfortunate death of Caliph Mustansir enabled the shrewd vizier Afdal Shahanshah to perform a scurrilous coup. While lying on his deathbed, Mustansir has allegedly spurned his firstborn son Nizâr and appointed another son as heir instead. Immediately, Afdal installed him on the throne and demanded Nizâr's prostration in front of his brother under threat of his death. Through a trick, however, Nizâr was able to escape from the palace in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to Alexandria, where he was proclaimed Caliph Mustafâ by the local governor.\n\nAccording to Ismaili law, only the Caliph himself appoints his successor, but since this is not entirely clear at the moment, both Nizâr and his brother can claim the Caliphal title. Both enjoy the approval of our subjects, though this succession crisis will likely cause a religious schism."
 HREMA74: "Nizâr is a fool and shall be immured in our dungeon"
 HREMB74: "Execute everyone who opposes Nizâr!"
 HREMT75: "The Veche Republic"
 HREMD75: "The Veche or 'Council' originates from the pagan tribal assemblies of the Eastern Slavs, thus predating the Rus' state. Today, it consists of the most famous mayors, commanders, boyars and bishops of our nation and possesses a great deal of legislative and judicial power, especially in Novgorod. Favoured by the Rota system, the Veche alone has the right to appoint and depose our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s; it is a symbol of sovereignty and independence of the estates of Novgorod.\n\nIn recent years, the Veche of Novgorod has acquired much prominence while [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has gradually lost influence and approval among the estates of Novgorod. As a result, the Veche has convened in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to decide on the deposition of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 HREMA75: "Exile [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and appoint a new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 HREMTT75: "Lose all Personal Unions and gain permanent claims on all former union subject territory."
 HREMB75: "Execute all traitors!"
 HREMT76: "Novgorod the Renegade"
 HREMD76: "We have received a legation from the Principality of Novgorod, bringing disturbing news. The local aristocracy has deposed and expelled the previous prince to replace him with [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName]. Through this disgraceful act, they are not only rebelling against [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], but are also undermining the authority of the Kievan Rus itself!"
 HREMA76: "We must restore rule over Novgorod"
 HREMT77: "Harald III and the Varangian Guard"
 HREMD77: "After the battle of Stiklestad in 1030, at which Harald fought and was badly wounded, he escaped from Norway and arrived in Kievan Rus, where he and a force of 500 men enlisted in the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine army. During his time in the East, Harald soon rose to prominence as being the principal leader of an effective fighting force, launching campaigns as far east as Mesopotamia against Arab strongholds. He also fought in theaters such as Sicily, Bulgaria and Jerusalem, winning glory and countless riches, so much so that he could use the funds to claim the Norwegian crown. At first, he was highly esteemed in the Byzantine court, but after internal strife led to a new Emperor who was more hostile to Harald, he had to flee Constantinople in 1042 and arrived in Sweden by 1046. There, he prepared to oust the then Norwegian king Magnus the Good, but Magnus instead agreed to a compromise where the two would rule Norway jointly. This fell through when Magnus suddenly died in 1047, and Harald was able to assume the role of king in full.\nWith such a legacy, it is no wonder then that Harald's military knowledge could prove very useful to us; we only need to decide which aspect of our army to prioritize."
 HREMA77: "Use his knowledge to enrich our commanders"
 HREMB77: "Use his expertise to inspire our troops"
 HREMT80: "Fate of the Italian Greeks"
 HREMD80: "The ancient Greeks founded colonies all over the coast of the Mediterranean and Black Sea in the 8th and 7th centuries BC in order to cope with the rapid population growth in their homeland. Many of these colonies have perished centuries ago, but southern Italy is still inhabited by a considerable number of Greeks, living in the Byzantine provinces of Magna Graecia.\n\nWith the conquest of the last Byzantine fortress in Italy, the peninsula now belongs entirely to the Italians, raising the question of how we will deal with the Greek people now living under our authority. Although the Greeks are considered the advocates of the ancient civilization, we could initiate a de-Hellenization and absorb their cultural identity into ours."
 HREMA80: "Force them to abandon their culture and religion"
 HREMB80: "Strive for cooperation with the Greeks living in our realm"
 HREMT81: "Misery of the Assassins"
 HREMD81: "The Order of Assassins is known as a mysterious secret society of assassins who come from Persia and practice a strange form of Shia Islam. Stories of sultans and emirs who were miraculously murdered are known everywhere, long thought to be rumours, but these assassinations are attributed to the Assassins these days. Hiding in the shadows, countless members of this sect have infiltrated the courts and armies of the Middle East, ready to execute an order to kill at any moment.\n\nDamascus has long been controlled by Assassins from underground, where Assassin connections have recently been exposed. Anyone in collusion with the Assassins was publicly executed by the city's new governor, completely freeing the city from Assassin rule. However, the governor of Damascus was quickly murdered by the Order as an act of revenge afterwards. The survivors fled to the Syrian mountain region, where they established a shelter for persecuted Assassins in Banyas. Their power is diminished for the moment, but the Order of the Assassins might become an influential actor again in the future, spinning the political strings in the background."
 HREMA81: "Let's hope they're not after [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 HREMT82: "The Cross and the Raven"
 HREMD82: "In [GetYear], Sweden is far from being a wholly Christianized Kingdom. Although some past kings like Olof Skötkonung have called themselves devout Christians, the majority of the Swedish population still practices Norse rituals, especially in the remote hinterlands of the [Root.GovernmentName].\nAfter the death of Sweden's former monarch, the conflicts between Christian Geats and Pagan Swedes unfolded an armed conflict. While the recently crowned [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is considered a supporter of paganism, Christians are demanding the coronation of 'Erik the Christian'. This issue could develop into a bloody civil war that will decide the fate of Sweden."

The situation is such that the Portuguese have become concerned about [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerHis] growing powers and are determined to uphold their de facto independence. To this end the nobles have sought out a distant relative of the [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle], Henrique de Bourgogne, and are hoping to appoint him as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName].\nWhile this no doubt promises an opportunity to break away from any would-be oppressors and forge our own identity, there are likely to be repercussions in our relations with [Root.Overlord.GetName]."

 HREMB83: "We cannot risk angering [Root.Overlord.GetName]."
 HREMT84: "The Knights of the Reconquista"
 HREMD84: "In the course of the First Crusade, the concept of holy orders was born, which was soon adopted in the Christian monarchies of Iberia. Motivated by the desire for religious and pecuniary rewards, numerous holy orders were created, whose members promised to protect the Iberian pilgrimage routes, defend Christianity and expel the Moors from the peninsula. The Castilian Order of Calatrava, the Leonese Order of Alcántara, the Galician Order of Santiago, the Aragonese Order of Montesa and the Portuguese Order of Aviz belong to the most famous Iberian fraternities.\nInitially, these orders were mainly made up of former crusaders, however, by dint of papal privileges they quickly grew and would eventually consist of many Iberian nobles and knights. Through their encomiendas, these orders evolved not only into reliable soldiers of the Christian kingdoms during the Reconquista but also into key political and economic figures of Spain and Portugal whose influence would last for centuries."
 HREMA84: "Honor without stain!"
 hrema84.tt: "Christian nations of Iberia will get access to new mercenary companies."
 HREMT85: "Heir Blessed by Ahura Mazda"
 HREMD85: "As a result of our upholding of Good Tradition and practice of xvaetvadatha, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sibling-consort [Root.Consort.GetName] have been blessed with a new child who bears unique characteristics. Rumor has it that the baby, just like Prophet Zarathuštra himself, was born laughing! This can only be a good sign, and a testament to the purity of our sacred bloodline."
 HREMA85: "Wonderful"
 HREMT86: "Turkification"
 HREMD86: "The Greek population in $PROVINCENAME$, having embraced the true faith by submitting to Allah, has gradually come to adopt our customs and the Turkish language. For all intents and purposes, they have become Turks like us."
 HREMA86: "Selamünaleyküm!"
 HREMT87: "Seljuks Install Governor"
 HREMD87: "The Great Seljuk [SJK.Monarch.GetTitle] [SJK.Monarch.GetName] has demanded that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] step down and allow a lowborn governor to take over rule of the Khwarezm region. Just as Khwarezm was once a tributary realm to the great Sassanid Persian state under its own local dynasty, should we again heed their demands and accept their proposed new leadership?"
 HREMA87: "Very well"
 HREMB87: "We bow to no one"
 HREMT89: "Free City of Riga"
 HREMD89: "For generations, German traders and missionaries have visited the mouth of the Daugava river to carry out their business. Recently, their population has grown to such an extent that they have established a new fortified city on the site of the ancient village of Riga. In order to assist us in pushing German Catholic influence in the area, the Pope has proclaimed that the city will be immediately recognized as a Free City enjoying the full protection of Western European powers."
 HREMA89: "A pleasant development..."
 HREMT90: "The Tannin"
 HREMD90: "Your loyal advisor, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName], enters into the court with a glass full of brown powder. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] starts speaking: 'My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I isolated the substance that makes our wine astringent. It has been used for other purposes, but we can increase the quality of our wine by increasing the quantity of this substance in our wine through aging. I call it 'tannin', from Latin 'tannare', meaning 'oak bark'.'"
 HREMA90: "Good job"
 HREMT91: "Breakaway of [silesia_partition_country.GetName]"
 HREMD91: "Though we expected the first partition and the subsequent disputes over land in Silesia to be the first and only, circumstances over inheritance and infighting between sons has led to the question of another partition in [Root.GetName], concerning the breakaway of our younger son's domain of [silesia_partition_country.GetName]. We can accept this in the hope that we will unite the lost land to our territory once again, but the effects could be severe if we decline to give greater autonomy..."
 HREMA91: "Accept the partition"
 HREMB91: "Fight to keep [Root.GetName] united"
 HREMT92: "The Partition of [Root.GetName]"
 HREMD92: "Even after Poland itself struggles with the forces of fragmentation, [Root.GetName] has remained fairly intact and has even stood to benefit from the chaos, having become independent of their former masters. However, on the previous monarch's deathbed, the very unity of the state was undone when it was proclaimed that the country would be divided among their two sons. The elder, [Root.Monarch.GetName], will control the western region with their seat in Wroclaw while the younger, Mieszko, will rule the east from Opole. We could ignore this will entirely however, but this is likely to provoke resistance from Mieszko."
 HREMA92: "Accept the partition"
 HREMB92: "Fight to keep [Root.GetName] united"
 HREMC92: "Accept the partition, but play as Opole"
 HREMTT92: "All Silesian Duchies will gain cores on their historical territories and have a chance to become independent in future."
 HREMT93: "The Other Shadow Kingdom"
 HREMD93: "When Charlemagne's Frankish Empire was partitioned after his death, the Kingdom of Middle Francia was created as one of three successor states, standing between the realms of West Francia and East Francia. Shortly thereafter, its first King Lothair divided the title further between his own three sons, establishing the Kingdom of Italy, Kingdom of Burgundy, and the Kingdom of Lotharingia. Over time, the Holy Roman Emperors, successors to the Kings of East Francia, integrated Italy back into their realm. It was only later still, in 1033 AD, that Burgundy rejoined the empire.\n\nAs Imperial authority in the south has waned in recent centuries, however, the Imperial titles 'King of Italy' and 'King of Burgundy' have become increasingly meaningless as each tract of land was partitioned further and further among local nobles. Now, with the rulers of West Francia making inroads into Burgundy, the whole Francophone region has effectively slipped out of our grasp and into the sphere of influence of the West Frankish monarchs."
 HREMA93: "There is nothing we can do"
 HREMT94: "Loss Of Electoral Dignity"
 HREMD94: "The electoral titles to elect the next Emperor are certainly not strictly tied to their holders, but can rather alternate between the most powerful imperial princes.\nAs a result of our misjudgments and miscalculations in imperial politics in recent years, we have reached the point where our influence is no longer sufficient for us to cling to our electoral dignity. Consequently, the Emperor will reclaim the title and lend it to another, more meaningful prince."
 HREMA94: "What will this mean for us and the Empire?"
 HREMT95: "Understaffed Electoral College"
 HREMD95: "The tradition of an independent election of the Holy Roman Emperor began in 911, when the last Carolingian king of East Francia passed away without heir. Instead of appointing the king from West Francia as his successor, the East Frankish princes crowned one of their own, Duke Conrad I Konrading, as their new ruler. In the following decades, there were frequent changes of dynasty, as many kings left no direct male heir, which ultimately led to the creation of a permanent electoral college and the evolvement of an elective monarchy.\n\nDue to the political decline of an imperial elector, their electoral dignity has returned to the Empire and must be bestowed anew. Without a legal code on the exact rights and duties of the Electors, we can only act in a very limited way in this matter however.\nOur advisors have identified three of the most important and influential imperial princes who are now nominated to obtain the vacant electoral title. We must decide wisely which of the three princes we will choose as it will turn him into one of the most powerful princes of the Empire."
 HREMA95: "Pick [new_elector_1.Monarch.GetTitle] [new_elector_1.Monarch.GetName] of [new_elector_1.GetName]"
 HREMB95: "Pick [new_elector_2.Monarch.GetTitle] [new_elector_2.Monarch.GetName] of [new_elector_2.GetName]"
 HREMC95: "Pick [new_elector_3.Monarch.GetTitle] [new_elector_3.Monarch.GetName] of [new_elector_3.GetName]"
 HREMT96: "Electorship Received"
 HREMD96: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], who is known for [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] extraordinary generosity and wisdom, conferred on us the electoral dignity, the most coveted title in the entire Empire, after a former elector lost it due to their political decline. Undoubtedly, this is a clear sign that the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] appreciates our significant influence in the Empire, hoping for our support in [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] ambitions and in the next imperial election.\nThis act will expand our political possibilities immensely in the future!"
 HREMA96: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] will not regret his decision"
 HREMT97: "A Burgeoning Scholar"
 HREMD97: "In 1085, Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali entered [6301.GetName]. He was taught in the sciences of Fiqh, Aqeedah, Kalam and Falsafa by the great scholar of his time, Imam Al-Haramayn Al-Juwayni. It is evident that he has a brilliant mind; even the most esteemed scholars at the Nizamiyya are amazed by his insights. He would be a great addition to our court, providing invaluable advice, or we could promote him to work at the Nizamiyya itself; his insights into the religious sciences could be profound and enlightening."
 HREMA97: "Bring him to court"
 HREMB97: "Make him a professor at the Nizamiyya"
 HREMT98: "Refutation of the Falasifa"
 HREMD98: "Al-Ghazali has appeared at court one day with a request. He explains that his latest work, a four-part theological treatise that refutes the Aristotlian systems and beliefs of the Falasifa, is facing heavy opposition within the scholarly sphere. He is requesting our support in his endeavors to spread the correct Aqidah. Helping him would seem too much like favoritism, but would be invaluable in spreading [Root.Religion.GetName] Islam against the Falasifa and Shia."
 HREMA98: "Support his work"
 HREMB98: "Leave him to his own devices"
 HREMT99: "Death of a Mujaddid"
 HREMD99: "Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali was the foremost religious scholar of his time. No one could rival him in intelligence, insight and argument. He was granted many honorable titles such as 'Proof of Islam' and 'religious reviver'. His death is one that will leave a gap in the field of Islam that may never be filled again. All we are left with are the works that he has written, nearing 70 in their number."
 HREMA99: "Promote his Fiqh"
 HREMB99: "Promote his Tasawwuf"
 HREMT100: "Principality of [rus_partition_country.GetName] Secedes"
 HREMD100: "At the death of our former illustrious ruler, chaos was bound to have set in. As the Kievan Rus' continues its decline, more power is being concentrated in the hands of regional authority and one such region, [rus_partition_country.GetName], is seeking an independent principality of its own. With a member of the [rus_partition_country.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty, [rus_partition_country.Monarch.GetName], at the helm, they are not willing to give up this opportunity without a fight and we may have a bloody conflict on our hands if we do not acquiesce."
 HREMA100: "Acknowledge [rus_partition_country.Monarch.GetName]'s claims"
 HREMTT100: "We will lose our cores on [rus_partition_country.GetAdjectiveCap] provinces, and they will become independent."
 HREMB100: "Contest [rus_partition_country.Monarch.GetName]'s claims"
 HREMT101: "Break with Kievan Rus?"
 HREMD101: "With [Root.Overlord.GetName] facing internal turmoil and a lack of political legitimacy, our local aristocracy have increasingly shunned our de jure overlord and begun clamoring for [Root.GetName] to strike out on its own, independent of the antiquated Kievan Rus. They have chosen a pretender of their own from our dynasty who will be committed to severing ties with [Root.Overlord.GetName], yet this will depend on whether [Root.Monarch.GetName] agrees to step down. Failing this, the faction promises that there will be a revolt on our hands."
 HREMA101: "Exile [Root.Monarch.GetName] and appoint a new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 HREMB101: "Execute all traitors!"
 HREMT102: "The Loss of [From.GetName]"
 HREMD102: "We have received a legation from the Principality of [From.GetName], bringing disturbing news. The local aristocracy has deposed and expelled the previous prince to replace him with [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName]. Through this disgraceful act, they are not only rebelling against [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], but are also undermining the authority of the Kievan Rus itself!"
 HREMA102: "We must restore rule over [From.GetName]"
 HREMT103: "Battle of the Golden Spurs"
 HREMD103: "The Flemish people, tired of the French, revolted and assembled several militias. In 1302, during the Franco-Flemish War, French mounted French men-at-arms were routed by Flemish militia at Kortrijk, whom captured 500 pairs of spurs. The Battle of the Golden Spurs was a resounding Flemish victory and showed the world the strength and determination of Flanders."
 HREMA103: "To Victory!"
 HREMT104: "Prosperity of Flanders"
 HREMD104: "The Flemish are well established in commerce throughout all of Christendom, from England to the Hanseatic Cities to France to the Rhineland to even the rich merchant republics of Italy. Cloth production has driven many Flemish cities to new levels of prosperity, Flemish grain is shipped throughout Europe, and the Flemish city of Saint-Omer has become the largest port for French wine. The economic future of Flanders looks to be nothing but promising."
 HREMA104: "A New Era of Prosperity!"
 HREMT105: "The Decapolis"
 HREMD105: "After successive alliances of several Alsatian Free Cities to preserve their liberties against and impose a peaceful order, the Emperor allowed them to form a league of cities in [GetYear]. The members promise to defend their independence against surrounding rulers and assist each other militarily in internal and external conflicts.\nAlthough all members will share the same rights, [Root.GetName] will play a leading role in the affairs of the League when it is given the task of inviting to conferences, conducting correspondence and maintaining contact with the Emperor."
 HREMA105: "For the protection of our mutual interests"
 HREMT106: "Swiss Seek for Autonomy"
 HREMD106: "Our Swiss subjects have begun to develop a certain sense of self-determination. They are expecting us to give up our rule over them and recognize a sovereign patriciate instead. Should we agree?"
 HREMA106: "Let them be free"
 HREMB106: "They must obey us"
 HREMT107: "Cultural Changes in [Root.GetName]"
 HREMD107: "For some time now, [Root.GetName] has experienced an influx of foreign settlers, coming mostly from Swabia, Westphalia and the Lowlands. Constantly in contact with the [Root.Culture.GetName] locals, both groups have begun to adopt customs, traditions and even language of each other into their everyday life.\nThis exchange has not only led to a cultural blending, but also to a cultural shift in the province."
 HREMA107: "An interesting development"
 HREMB107: "Do everything to revert this"
 HREMT108: "Cultural Assimilation in [Root.GetName]"
 HREMD108: "During the course of [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] subjugation of the Baltic tribes, the lands conquered by them have become depopulated and ravaged by war, including [Root.GetName]. In the absence of many of its native inhabitants, who have either died or been forced to flee, there has been an influx of Germans into the province seeking new lands to colonize."
 HREMA108: "An interesting development"
 HREMT109: "Hungarians of Székelyföld"
 HREMD109: "For many centuries, the Székelys ('frontier guards') of Hungary have been serving as protectors of the Carpathian basin, yet in increasing numbers they have recently begun to settle the frontier regions of Transylvania, now known as the Székely Land. They will assuredly help us fend off any foreign threats, and we can encourage their migration further into this region."
 HREMA109: "We need all the help we can get!"
 HREMB109: "We will be better off without them."
 HREMT110: "Saxons of Királyföld"
 HREMD110: "Transylvania, although sheltered by mountains on its eastern and southern flanks, is still vulnerable to invasions by Turkic hordes and surrounding tribes. In a bid to better protect the region from nearby threats, we could invite foreign settlers, specifically German craftsmen, soldiers and miners from the Holy Roman Empire, to assist us in building up the region's defense and economy."
 HREMA110: "We need all the help we can get!"
 HREMB110: "We will be better off without them."
 HREMT111: "Outlawed"
 HREMD111: "One of our cities has recently been repeatedly ravaged by muggers who raid and rob locals and passing merchants. Many do not dare to visit the city or to leave the house at night anymore. We must locate these bandits and restore order of the region before it becomes a criminal sanctuary."
 HREMA111: "Build a new garrison"
 HREMB111: "Hunt them down"
 HREMT112: "Philistines"
 HREMD112: "Some of our advisors do not seem to realize the importance of a culture. For many of them, what counts is the strength of our army or the religiousness of our people, but not the promotion of painting or music, let alone the construction of monuments and theatres. Shall we disabuse these buffoons?"
 HREMA112: "Teach them"
 HREMB112: "Ignore them"
 HREMT113: "Fortune Favours The Bold"
 HREMD113: "A trading post placed in our capital by our foreign trading partners has been very profitable for us in recent weeks. We have not only generated a large amount of revenue, we have also seen some new improved trading practices to modernize our own trade. Without the skilful administrative talent of the druids, we would never have been able to achieve this."
 HREMA113: "Collect the money"
 HREMB113: "Reward the druids"
 HREMT114: "Martial Traditions"
 HREMD114: "Our people have a long and victorious war tradition, thanks to which we are experienced and brave fighters today. A young man who has served as a simple soldier in a clan army up to now impresses with his martial skills among his ranks. Our traditions imply that only men of noble blood have the right to lead our armies, but this time we could break them and appoint this common man a general."
 HREMA114: "Accept him"
 HREMB114: "Reject him"
 HREMT115: "Boisterous Feast"
 HREMD115: "The filid are planning a grand festival of several days in our capital, where people will sing, dance and celebrate around the clock. This would certainly bring a lot of joy to our subjects and make the city an attractive place to trade during the festival. All they need is our permission for their project."
 HREMA115: "Approve it"
 HREMB115: "Cancel it"
 HREMT116: "Outdated Administration"
 HREMD116: "Since our nation was founded, the druids have been responsible for the administration of our country using traditional and rather simple methods. While we continue to maintain such a system, many of our neighbors have already adopted more modern principles, resulting in a positive impact on them. We should consider reforming the administration in a progressive way."
 HREMA116: "Leave it to the druids"
 HREMB116: "Reform the administration"
 HREMT117: "Clan Assembly"
 HREMD117: "The leaders of the flatha, the filid and the druids have come together at our court today to discuss the future of our country with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Each of them has different ideas about how we should lead our nation, so we need to choose a side we want to support in the near future."
 HREMA117: "Favour the flatha"
 HREMB117: "Favour the filid"
 HREMC117: "Favour the druids"
 HREMT118: "Architecture Enthusiast"
 HREMD118: "An experienced master builder drew our attention to himself. In his hometown, he has made a name for himself by constructing impressive houses that have been able to withstand every storm. We could win this architectural genius for ourselves by giving him a position, but where?"
 HREMA118: "At our construction sites"
 HREMB118: "In our army"
 HREMC118: "At our church designers"
 HREMT119: "Demand for Power"
 HREMD119: "An influential flaith desires a high position at our court and promises us his fullest loyalty in return. According to rumours, he was involved in greasy state affairs and did not hesitate to get rid of his political rivals in the past. Therefore, we must consider carefully whether or not to promote his exceptional capabilities."
 HREMA119: "Accept his aid"
 HREMB119: "Refuse his aid"
 HREMT120: "Court Ceremony"
 HREMD120: "A ritual court ceremony in honour of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will take place in a few days. The preparations are in full swing, although the current question is who we should invite for this unique spectacle. Usually, only high officials are present, but we could make an exception and invite our neighbors as well."
 HREMA120: "Invite our subjects"
 HREMB120: "Invite our neighbors"
 HREMT121: "Rise of the Italian Communes"
 HREMD121: "Over the course of the medieval period, the inhabitants of the densely populated cities in Northern Italy have come to demand greater independence and privileges in order to protect their inhabitants and resist the whims of lawless nobles. Now, spurred on by the recent Investiture Controversy, these cities have taken advantage of the Emperor's precarious situation and begun to form communes independent from their former masters. The consequences of this are as yet uncertain, but already tensions are on the rise between feudal and communal states which could lead to factional conflicts in the future."
 HREMA121: "An intriguing development..."
 HREMA121TT: "The §YItalian Communes§! begin to appear."
 HREMT122: "[italian_commune_country.GetName] Demands Independence"
 HREMD122: "Among the many communes in northern Italy clamoring for greater autonomy is [italian_commune_country.GetName], who are demanding rights and privileges that would effectively make them independent of our control. We can either concede to their demands or try to keep them integrated into our state, but the latter option will provoke harsh resistance from the commune administration."
 HREMA122: "Give them independence"
 HREMA122TT: "§Y[italian_commune_country.GetName]§! is released with §Rall their core provinces§! in Italy; we will lose cores on their territory and establish a truce with them.\n\n§IItalian Communes may demand independence until the end of the Age of Holy Wars as long as we are part of the Holy Roman Empire.§!"
 HREMB122: "Refuse to grant privileges"
 HREMT123: "Expulsion of Moors From $PROVINCENAME$"
 HREMD123: "Since the Umayyad Caliphate invaded the Visigoths in the eighth century, Iberia has gradually developed a mixed culture of Muslims and Morisco converts. As part of the project set in motion by Pelayo d'Asturias five centuries ago, we have taken it upon ourselves to drive the heathens back over the Straits of Gibraltar and restore the integrity of the Christian Iberian kingdom.\nThe Moorish settlers and converts in the recently-conquered province of $PROVINCENAME$ have been given an ultimatum: leave immediately by your own volition, or be forced out by the sword."
 HREMA123: "The Reconquista continues!"
 HREMT124: "Dictionary of the Khazars"
 HREMD124: "To preserve the ancient and holy Khazar language in the wake of the destruction of the Khazar Khaganate, it is necessary to create an encyclopedic dictionary of our tongue. We have enlisted a travelling Serbian scholar named Milorad Pavic to assist us in this great endeavor."
 HREMA124: "Great"
 HREMT125: "The Fate of the Catepanate"
 HREMD125: "Since Justinian's reconquest of Italy under the legendary general Belisarius in the sixth century, some part of the peninsula has always been under Byzantine power, first as an Exarchate and then as a Catepanate. In recent years, the Catepan's effective control has dwindled to only a few coastal outposts under the onslaught of the Norman pilgrims-turned-adventurers who have expanded throughout our rightful land using Melfi as a base.\n\nThe fall of these last few outposts to the Normans after lengthy sieges is hailed by many as the end of our presence in a region that we should have abandoned long ago to focus on the heartland and the threats to our east. Perhaps they are right and it is time to sue for a lasting peace."
 HREMA125: "We must accept that Italy is lost"
 HREMB125: "Keep up the fight!"
 HREMT126: "Jalal Al-Din Rumi"
 HREMD126: "Trying to escape the horrendous acts of the Mongols in Persia, Jalal Al-Din Rumi and his family fled west. They have done their Hajj, and now are planning on settling in [Root.GetName]. Rumi is an esteemed Hanafi jurist and has a reputation as an excellent teacher. We could leave him to his devices, dealing with more important matters, or invite him to work at our madrasa in [6790.GetName], ensuring the integrity of our scholarship."
 HREMA126: "Grant him a position in [6790.GetName]"
 HREMB126: "Leave him alone"
 HREMT127: "Passing of Rumi"
 HREMD127: "After we granted him a position as a teacher in the head madrasa of [6790.GetName], Rumi met Shams Tabrizi. Shams taught him about the way of the Sufis, and excelled in it. After Shams' death, Rumi became the foremost master in the science of Tasawwuf, students coming to learn by his feet from all around the land of Islam. Now that he has met his Lord, we are informed of his magnum opus, a 24,000 verse work of Persian poetry that can humble the hardest of souls. However, some of the wording in it is vague, and can be interpreted in a heretical manner. What shall we do with such a piece?"
 HREMA127: "Promote the Mathnawi"
 HREMB127: "Better to keep it unread"
 HREMT128: "Yunus Emre and His Poetry"
 HREMD128: "We have received news of Yunus Emre, a Turkish Sufi travelling around Anatolia and spreading his poetry. He claims to be travelling on the path of Jalal Al-Din Rumi, drawing heavy inspiration from his Mathnawi. Except there is one very unique thing about Yunus: he writes in Turkish. He is the first Turkish poet in history, and the Turks of Anatolia are delighted to have a cultural figure such as Yunus Emre representing them."
 HREMA128: "Subhanallah!"
 HREMT129: "Ibn Rushd"
 HREMD129: "The court advisors have come and explained to us the situation with a certain man called Ibn Rushd. Ibn Rushd, a Faylasuf in his creed, has made quite a scene in the field of Aqidah with his writings. He has written refutation of Imam Al-Ghazali's Tahafut, and expounded in length on the writings of Aristotle. His fame has even spread to the Christians, who have started calling him 'The Commentator'. We need to take a stance in the debate; either support Ibn Rushd and his philosophy, or back the rising tide of Ash'ari theologians."
 HREMA129: "Appoint him as Qadi"
 HREMB129: "Banish him"
 HREMT130: "English-French Rivalry"
 HREMD130: "As we have seized more and more of the kingdom of France's de-jure territory, we have provoked their ire enough that they no longer wish to tolerate our presence on the land they see as rightfully theirs. This is sure to be the beginning of a long and drawn out rivalry between us and them."
 HREMA130: "Have at them!"
 HREMT132: "Convening a Diet"
 HREMD132: "As the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, it is our duty to organize regular assemblies throughout the Empire, where the Emperor consults with the princes, who present their own concerns to him in turn. This ties the imperial princes closely to the Emperor and ensures that the Emperor is always informed about events and issues in the Empire.\nThe current peacetime might be suitable for a Diet to learn about the most important interests of our Thuringian and Saxon subjects. Shall we summon the princes?"
 HREMA132: "Erfurt is ideally situated for this purpose"
 hrema132.tt: "We will send invitations to all Thuringian and Saxon princes"
 HREMB132: "There is still time for a Diet next year"
 HREMT133: "Diet Invitation"
 HREMD133: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has invited us to a Diet in the Thuringian city of Erfurt to debate about the current affairs of the Holy Roman Empire. This event could help us to develop better relations with the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] and strengthen the political position of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nDo we accept the invitation?"
 HREMA133: "Yes, saddle our horses"
 HREMB133: "No, we will decline"
 HREMT134: "A Blissful Diet"
 HREMD134: "Today, many of the invited princes and bishops assembled in Erfurt to participate at the Diet recently called by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. To debate the current affairs and concerns of the Holy Roman Empire, the participants came together on the highest floor of the local cathedral provostry.\nA serious dispute between the Archbishop of Mainz and the Landgrave of Thuringia quickly developed into the main topic of the meeting. For hours, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] listened to the arguments of the two men, the creaking sounds of the wooden floor and the birds chirping outside were drowned out by the volume of the heated discussion. Finally, at sunset, [Root.Monarch.GetName] pronounced an arbitral award that appeased both sides and ended their long quarrel.\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has truly proved [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wisdom, justice and staunchness on this day, qualities which will be remembered for a long time."
 HREMA134: "Perfect!"
 HREMT135: "The Erfurt Latrine Disaster"
 HREMD135: "Today, many of the invited princes and bishops assembled in Erfurt to participate at the Diet recently called by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].

The impact of the extraordinary load of the strike also caused the lower floor below to collapse, prompting the crowd to fall even deeper into a latrine below.\nThe pit full of excretions should turn out to be a deadly trap for some of these men. Unable to escape from the slurry, several princes drowned or suffocated, others were killed by falling beams or debris. Miraculously, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] survived this accident, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was sitting in a stone window alcove at the time the floor crashed.\nThe sad deaths of many princes pushed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to instantly abort the Diet early, leaving many important agendas and issues unaddressed."

 HREMD140: "Al-Andalus represented the most important center for Jewish culture and science in the 10th century. Thanks to the patronage of the Caliphs, several important Jewish figures held high positions at the Caliphal court. As a result, Al-Andalus attained prosperity and affluence. Jewish scholars at that time made decisive contributions to poetry, philosophy, medicine, geography, mathematics and much more.\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to promise a committed and emerging Jewish scholar of our country the opportunity to be employed at the [Root.GetAdjective] court.

The Utraquists sought to negotiate and find common ground with the Catholic Church. They demanded the freedom to receive Communion under both forms, a practice the Church prohibited.

 FBIT1: "Fall of the Babenbergs"
 FBID1: "For centuries the house of Babenberg has defended the empire's eastern frontier. The last Babenberg monarch, Friedrich II, tried to seize upon the Mongol invasion of Hungary by grabbing several border counties for himself. He underestimated the Hungarians' resolve, however, and was killed in the ensuing counterattack on the banks of the River Leitha in June of 1246.\nLeaving no male heirs behind, his titles became contested between the claims of his daughters Margarete and Gertrude. The former aligned herself with the Premyslids of Bohemia, while the latter betrayed her Premyslid connections for the Swabian margrave Hermann of Baden. The local nobility of Austria and Styria must decide whether to support the vagrant margrave who currently roams the land seeking recognition, or the more powerful kingdom to the north."
 FBIA1: "Support the Premyslids"

 FBIC1: "Prop up a local pretender"
 FBIT2: "Good News"
 FBID2: "The interregnum following the agnatic extinction of the Babenberg dynasty in Austria and Styria has paved the way for the advancement of our interests. It seems that the local nobility in [From.GetName] has sided with us, allowing one of our statesmen to ascend the throne."
 FBIA2: "Long may they reign!"
 FBIT3: "$PROVINCECAPITAL$ Seeks Hanseatic Status"
 FBID3: "With the rise of Guilds in the middle of the thirteenth century, a trade alliance formed between certain cities in Northern Germany which was to become known as 'the Hanseatic League'. Over the centuries, the league subsumed a large amount of cities across Northern Europe as a whole, ensuring cooperation and riches. The burghers of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ now seek to cash in on this lucrative opportunity, requesting our permission as sovereigns."
 FBIA3: "Grant it"
 FBIB3: "We aren't globalists!"
 FBIT4: "Last Will and Testament"
 FBID4: "The unfortunate passing of our monarch has created an interesting problem for the nation. The pious old fool adopted the robes of a monk and spent the last hours before death prostrated in prayer. Clearly this altered mental state led to the creation of such an outrageous Last Will and Testament - that the Leónese crown should be divided among all surviving children!\nThere are some who believe honoring these final wishes will strengthen our position against the Taifas, as several centralized states might be more effective than one thinly-stretched empire. At the same time, our siblings could simply plunge the realm into eternal civil war. Trying to nullify the content of the testament will be extremely unpopular, however, and undermine the legitimacy of our government."

 FBIT5: "Theocracy Unpopular"
 FBID5: "The Emperors of Germany have divided their nominal Lombard lands into a series of theocratic fiefs ruled by Count-Bishops. This arrangement has satisfied the people for some time, but revolutionary sentiment now appears to sweep across the cities of Northern Italy.\nEgged on by the greedy burghers of our city, and citing trumped-up 'abuses' by [Root.Monarch.GetName], a mob has marched on the Episcopal Palace and demands that the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] step down.\n\nIf we give in to such rabble, it is unlikely they will do anything but force a Republican government on our glorious city-state."
 FBIA5: "I am so old"
 FBIB5: "Call the city guard!"
 FBIT6: "Guelphs and Ghibellines"
 FBID6: "The resolution of the Investiture Controversy did not totally calm relations between the Holy See and the Empire. Across the Italian Peninsula, local powers down to the level of individual cities threw themselves behind one faction or another, implicitly supporting them and fighting their neighbors until both sides forgot what the conflict was ever about.\nAt the siege of Weinsberg in the early twelfth century, the Papal-aligned forces used 'Welf' as a rallying cry, while the Imperial-aligned forces used 'Wibellingen', the name of an important castle. From then on, the Italicized versions 'Guelph' and 'Ghibelline' would stick to each side.\nThough leaders would often switch back and forth between who they supported, neutrality was hardly an option in such a polarized environment."

 FBIT7: "The Death of [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]"
 FBID7: "The death of the last [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Tuscany has witnessed the disintegration of the state into warring communes and upstart city-states. Though the title has existed since the Roman Empire fell in AD 476, it now passes into the annals of history as old Langobard Stem Duchies give way to smaller feuds."
 FBIA7: "So be it"
 FBID8: "The deep devotion of the Avignon Catholiques in Avignon has awakened a desire for an independent state ruled by Popes of the Church. A large part of the population has expressed support for the idea of such an establishment and has now turned to $MONARCH$ for approval."

 FBIT10: "Rise of the Beyliks"
 FBID10: "With the establishment of the Sultanate of Rûm, we thought Seljuk domination of Anatolia was unshakable. Now, however, after a series of crushing defeats by the Mongols and a continued string of inept rulers, our Sultanate's hold over disparate tribal warlords is declining, and several have begun to assert their independence as 'Beys'.\nWith such dedicated and highly-trained armies there is little we can do to stop them, but we may hope that they too descend into decadence over time just as we did before them."

They call this bill the Great Charter - Magna Carta - and promise their obedience if the court goes along with its issue. From now on, according to the charter, [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s will have to rule with the consent of a Parliament, comprised of the most important landowning vassals in the state.\n\nHow should we react to this strange dictum?"
 FBIA49: "We must sign it"
 FBIB49: "Crush the rabble!"
 FBIT50: "Rehabilitating Privateers"
 FBID50: "It's no secret that privateering, or indeed lawless piracy itself, is a far cry from the organized, disciplined ranks of an official state navy. There are, however, many parallels, and ships that excel in the legally ambiguous departments may also excel in warfare.\nThis is the idea behind a bill put forth by one of our top advisors to integrate a former privateering force into the navy. These man will require retraining, but it is believed that we can work with them."
 FBIA50: "We can live with this"
 FBIT51: "Spoils of Piracy"
 FBID51: "You can almost see the ship straining under the additional wait of its cargo - stolen goods and merchandise from our rivals abroad. Now we simply have to decide what to do with such riches - add them directly to the state's coffers, or reinvest them in these privateering programs?\n\nOf course, all that will happen after we let the crews take their fair share."
 FBIA51: "To the state"
 FBIB51: "Invest it"
 FBIT52: "Privateers Return Dividends"
 FBID52: "The continued success of our privateering operations have strengthened the overall power of our merchants in the region. While our neighbors' ships quake in fear of the black flag, our own men can sail around as they please, heightening their demand abroad. The government is already feeling the effects of this mercantile boost."
 FBIA52: "Wonderful"
 FBIT53: "A Pirate Fleet"
 FBID53: "Wars have taken their toll on our nation, and our navy is one of many institutions that has seen better days. We could, of course, attempt to use our privateering and pirate forces to succor this issue.\nWe must decide whether to keep these pirates as a reserve force, or have them immediately set out to take an active role, easing the pressure on our regular forces."
 FBIA53: "Send them out"
 FBIB53: "Keep them as reserves"
 FBIT54: "The Pirate Life"
 FBID54: "The life of a pirate is not all swashbuckling and adventures on the high seas. In many cases it involves enduring grueling conditions of weather and food supply, a sort of fortitude our employed troops would do well to learn from.\nThankfully our investment in privateering has rubbed off on the official navy, as many captains and crews alike have picked up tricks from their more unorthodox counterparts."
 FBIA54: "Great"
 FBIT55: "Piracy Policy"
 FBID55: "Our reliance on pirates has increased their power in the area, some would say too much. We are being urged by several top advisors to attempt to impose further regulations on piracy and more clearly delineate between pirate and privateer.\nOur scribes are preparing a new policy edict - how shall we address this issue?"
 FBIA55: "Let them roam free"
 FBIB55: "Crack down on it"
 FBIT56: "Going Legitimate"
 FBID56: "One of the most fearsome pirate lords of our age, scourge of the high seas, is in deals with our naval commanders to go legitimate. He wants to be employed by the state as a special consultant, and promises us great success if we assign him on high-stakes naval missions. Many scoff at his attempts, however, explaining that you can never make such a vile criminal bow to the sacred offices of the [Root.GetAdjective] navy.\nOnce a pirate, always a pirate."
 FBIA56: "Give him a chance"
 FBIB56: "Indeed"
 FBIT57: "Never Trust a Pirate"
 FBID57: "We authorized a certain privateer crew to attack and seize a great shipment of gold and silver reportedly being moved by one of our rival states. It has come to our attention now that the crew was successful in the endeavor, but driven mad by their lust for riches, have violated our lawful treaty and have made off with the money themselves, spending it haphazardly around the nation. We cannot let such an outrageous betrayal happen again!"
 FBIA57: "Curses!"
 FBIT58: "Unlicensed Shipbuilders"
 FBID58: "Obviously in keeping the high standards of [Root.GetName] alive in reputation, we impose strict licenses surrounding such matters as shipbuilding. It follows that a black market has developed in turn to fund the building and repair of less legally-inclined sailing ventures. Now that we have opened channels with so-called 'pirates' and given them a legal protection for their actions, we could also try to harness the power of these illicit shipwrights under the proper circumstances. Should we attempt to employ them to reinvigorate our trade fleet?"
 FBIA58: "Licenses for all"
 FBIB58: "We don't need them"
 FBIT59: "Lawsuit"
 FBID59: "An angry merchant who ran into trouble at the hands of our pirates has filed a suit against the state, alleging various oversights and misdeeds by the naval commissions in charge of managing privateers. The courts have been scandalized, and public opinion on the matter has been quite volatile. As the trial continues, the blame could very well fall on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]."
 FBIA59: "Le tribunal c'est moi"
 FBIT60: "Heresy brewing in Occitania"
 FBID60: "Rumors have been circulated by travelers passing through remote mountain valleys in Southern France that agents of a vile heretical movement, the Bogomilists, have been sending missionaries to preach their poison amongst the French people. This news somehow made it to the Pope himself, who has urgently requested that we send a team of bishops to the area to see if the rumors hold any water and to condemn these travelling heresiarchs if they are found.\nHopefully they will return with word that the whole story is more nonsense from the gossip-monger peasants and we can get this whole matter behind us, like that business in Gévaudan with the supposed man-eating wolf."
 FBIA60: "We must investigate the allegations"
 fbia60.tt: "Our top prelates will appraise the extent of the heresy"
 FBIT68: "Anabaptists take $PROVINCENAME$"
 FBID68: "When Martin Luther spread Protestantism across Europe, he brought with him a cavalcade of minor heresies and competing sects, each with views more bizarre than the last. One of such sects is the Anabaptists, who contend that baptism should be reserved for informed adults; those who were baptized as children should be re-baptized; and tout extremely radical ideas about property.\nWe would normally not concern ourselves with this rabble, but a heresiarch preacher in our capital has riled up these Anabaptists into a full-scale insurrection, taking over the administrative palaces and barricading the city walls. We must send in the army!"
 FBIA68: "Wipe them out"
 FBIT69: "Tempting Ideas"
 FBID69: "The Protestant Reformation has brought with it a host of strange and novel ideas about the Christian faith. One of the more esoteric views has come to be known as 'Anabaptism', referring to those who believe people should only be baptized as adults when they can make an informed, rational decision.\nWhen [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was travelling through [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] Square recently, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] came across a mendicant preacher promoting the Anabaptist way of life. Before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] guards could beat the man down, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stopped them and continued to listen to his public sermon. It seems the preacher was quite tempting, as East Frisia is now considering a conversion to this strange new sect."
 FBIA69: "Convert"
 FBIB69: "Stick to our faith"
 FBIT70: "Treaty of Venice"
 FBID70: "The status of the Papacy within the Holy Roman Empire has always been dubious, as the donations of Pepin and Constantine and the nominal role of Rome as the Empire's capital muddy the waters regarding what degree of freedom we should have. With the Investiture Controversy in mind, and the rise of Guelph-Ghibelline strife across the Italian peninsula, perhaps it is time to seek de-jure independence from the conglomeration calling itself Holy and Roman."
 FBIA70: "Declare Independence"
 FBIB70: "Tie our fate to the Empire"
 FBIT71: "Guglielma of Milan"
 FBID71: "In 1260 a holy woman arrived in Milan named Guglielma, and quickly gained a large following for her piety. Her disciples claimed she was the physical incarnation of the Holy Spirit and was destined to lead the Catholic Church as the first Popess. Though Guglielma denied this herself, she did preach an apocalyptic vision of the church, in which extant power structures would be torn down and replaced with an all-female clergy. Later frescos of Guglielma even display her ordaining women as priests.\n\nHow should the Papacy react to these outlandish notions?"
 FBIA71: "It is the will of the Holy Spirit"
 FBIB71: "This is heresy!"
 FBIT72: "The Dominicans"
 FBID72: "A Spanish theologian named Dominic has established a small monastic community dedicated to scholarly and pedagogical matters. Many Christians look to Dominic's model with admiration, and seek to join this new way of life. The College of Cardinals sees no objection to granting Dominic's followers an official constitution and incorporating them as a new Order within the Catholic Church, the Ordo Praedicatorum. Their didactic talents will be useful in combating heresy."
 FBIA72: "Mirabile dictu!"
 FBIT73: "Francis of Assisi"
 FBID73: "The son of a wealthy merchant has donated all of his belongings to the poor and forsaken the very concept of property, aiming to live according to the model of Christ and his apostles. Unlike various heresies which tried to push a similar message, this Francis maintains strict obedience to the Catholic Church and the Roman Pontiff, which he enforces diligently upon his followers. In a dream last night, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw the Roman church crumbling to the ground, while Francis stood alone holding it up. That this was a vision from the Lord God is obvious - we must approve the mendicant's pending application for approval of his new order, the Ordo Fratrum Minorum."
 FBIA73: "He will surely be canonized!"
 FBIT74: "The Holy Inquisition"
 FBID74: "For most of its history, the Catholic Church suppressed heresy with theological debate and, if that failed, condemnation and imprisonment. The rise of Catharism and Waldensianism simultaneously in Southern France presented a new challenge, as these traditional methods proved ineffective. In 1184, more drastic measures were taken with the establishment of the Episcopal Inquisition. Under this dictum, teams of two trained clerics would go city to city trying and punishing suspected heretics, with a maximum penalty of death by immolation.\nOver the centuries this innovation would see many uses, including a more violent state-run imitation in Christian Iberia, though it was originally maintained by monastic orders like the Dominicans. The effectiveness of the Dominican inquisition earned them the punning nickname 'Domini Canes' - 'Hounds of the Lord'."
 FBIA74: "Establish an Inquisition"
 FBIB74: "We do not need it"
 FBIT75: "Artist Laureate"
 FBID75: "A [Root.Culture.GetName] painter has raised the eyebrows of connoisseurs and critics around the region with his staggeringly beautiful artwork. He has brought great honor to our people, and should be given new patronage under the state!"
 FBIA75: "We have the best artists, folks"
 FBIT76: "Linguistic Breakthrough"
 FBID76: "Scholars have long puzzled over the origin of the [Root.Culture.GetName] language. Suggestions range from Tamil to Macedonian to proto-Albanian to the hypothetical ur-ultrafrench. A new monograph, however, has discovered convincing comparative evidence that [Root.Culture.GetName] was indeed the first language of them all, having been spoken by the first humans ever to dwell on earth. Many already suspected as much, but this is fresh evidence to add to the pile."
 FBIA76: "Could it be true?"
 FBIT77: "[Root.Culture.GetName] Settlers"
 FBID77: "In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Wendish and Baltic lands experienced a surge of Germanization under what became termed the 'ostsiedlung' or 'east settling'. The people of our nation have developed a hunger to explore strange new lands, seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no man has gone before, marking the dawn of our own 'siedlung' golden age. We must encourage their enthusiasm!"
 FBIA77: "Send them off"
 FBIT78: "A New Museum?"
 FBID78: "A rich man in one of our cities has built up quite the collection of artifacts from our ancestors, a truly impressive monument to our cultural heritage. An earlier agreement involved a portion of state funds being set aside to construct a museum, allowing the populace at large to drink in the glory of our antique past. However, now that the rich owner is dead, there is nobody to enforce the deal. Should we still build the museum, or embezzle the funds for our own purposes?"
 FBIA78: "Go ahead with the project"
 FBIB78: "Use the supplies for other purposes"
 FBIT79: "Peasants Angered"
 FBID79: "Rabble at the fringes of our nation complain that they are being treated as second-class citizens due to the fact that they are not [Root.Culture.GetName]. This outrageous claim flies in the face of our entire juridical tradition, which grants privileges to all the recognized Nations of [Root.GetName]. No matter what our legates say, the peasants have been riled up into sedition and disobedience.\n\n[Root.Culture.GetName]s would never engage in these treasonous slanders!"
 FBIA79: "Thus always to rabble"
 FBIT80: "Successful Festival"
 FBID80: "Organizers have put together a sort of fair or festival to celebrate our unique culture and its virtues. The idea turned out to be a wild success, invigorating the local economy and causing a massive boost in business. The festival was so popular, in fact, that word spread to neighboring nations of its incomparably delicious local cuisine showcases and haunting folk choirs. Travelers from around the region now come yearly to experience the celebration."
 FBIA80: "Wonderful"
 FBIT81: "New Play Tantalizes Audiences"
 FBID81: "A [Root.Culture.GetName] playwright has crafted a tour-de-force that will ring through the ages. This heartbreaking work brings tears to the eyes of the most stoic and heartless onlookers, and runs the gamut from comedy to romance to existentialism to tragedy with unsurpassed genius. One could almost pick out any line and have an intriguing, mellifluous epitaph for one's eternal remains.\nShould we continue to let the play run within our own borders, or try to fund the cast in a venture to one of our neighboring states? It will bring great glory to our people and nation."
 FBIA81: "Capitalize on the success"
 FBIB81: "Send the troupe to another nation"
 FBIT82: "An Amazing Discovery"
 FBID82: "Word of the New World has obviously spread across the West at this point in time. Our nation's scholars have found new evidence to support a contentious proposal that the Genovese explorer Christopher Columbus was not, in fact, the first to rediscover these lost continents - it was rather an ancient explorer born in our lands!\nAlready many naysayers have come out of the woodwork to denounce these findings as chauvinist fiction, but there may be a grain of truth to them."
 FBIA82: "Incredible!"
 FBIB82: "This story sounds dubious"
 FBIT83: "Diplomatic Scandal"
 FBID83: "A top [Root.GetAdjective] statesman has been implicated in a massive scandal that threatens to bring down half the government if exposed. His misconduct will tarnish the reputation of the entire [Root.Culture.GetName] culture, so we must use any means necessary to make sure it doesn't get out.\nUnfortunately, the culprit has fled to some far away anarchic land, knowing he would be imprisoned or executed if he showed his face in our court. Our only option is to resort to the oldest method of persuasion short of a heavy club - bribery."
 FBIA83: "Pay off the families"
 FBIT84: "Heir Wounded in Tournament"
 FBID84: "Our advisors claimed that organizing a Tournament would signal the prestige of our nation and culture. It was expected, of course, that [Root.Heir.GetName] [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] would take part, likewise proving his martial strength before he leads the realm. This rash idea has backfired, however, as he was badly wounded in an accident in front of the whole crowd. Not only is his reputation ruined, but the effects of the injury could be permanent!\n\nEvery advisor who supported this idea must be held accountable, through blood or at least exile."
 FBIA84: "Walk it off"
 FBIB84: "Hire every doctor in the nation"
 FBIT85: "Logistical Benefits"
 FBID85: "Our attention to logistical matters has already strengthened our martial prowess! Naysayers argued that we needed burlier soldiers or bigger catapults and cannons, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] was steadfast in defending the importance of our logistics officers. We have been proven right in the end!"
 FBIA85: "We must celebrate"
 FBIT86: "Intensify Training?"
 FBID86: "Certain logistics officers think we should issue a series of reforms to standard military training in the interest of professionalism and resilience. This would, however, lower the number of recruits passing the program, leaving us with a smaller pool from which to draw soldiers.\nThe logistics experts claim they can offset the difference with more recruitment drives, but we remain unconvinced that these reforms are in the best interest of the state."
 FBIA86: "Enact the reforms"
 FBIB86: "Leave it be"
 FBIT87: "Logistically Talented General"
 FBID87: "Just as Scipio Africanus managed to escape from the Battle of Cannae, that paramount disaster for the Romans, and went on to defeat Hannibal Barca, sometimes one finds a military commander whose logistical talents are godly but who is less immediately noted for combat itself. One of our newest low-level generals has demonstrated an ability to pass through forests and over rivers like open roadways, and hop over fortress walls as if they were farmer's fences. Should we try to put him to use?"
 FBIA87: "Recruit him"
 FBIB87: "We have no need of his services"
 FBIT88: "Logistically Talented Admiral"
 FBID88: "Like Aeneas in that great storm, slicing through the cobbled foam of the sea, our newest admiral is like a wizard with speed and planning. There is no port in the world, from Tangier to Taiwan, of which he is not aware, and no old sailors' trick he won't utilize.\nOf course, his talents in outright warfare are not so great, but perhaps we can put him to use?"
 FBIA88: "Recruit him"
 FBIB88: "We have no need of his services"
 FBIT89: "Excellent Logistics"
 FBID89: "The logistics of [Root.GetName] are the envy of the region. Enter the royal courts, taverns, or military colleges of any neighboring state and you will hear awestruck discussion of how excellent our logistical branch is running. Some even whisper [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a soothsayer who can forsee the actions of hostile armies before they themselves have decided upon a course of action."
 FBIA89: "Great"
 FBIT90: "Secret Passages"
 FBID90: "Sometimes walled cities or castles would have a well-hidden passage, or even a long secret tunnel, leading in and out of them. Many important sieges in history have been successful due to traitors informing the besieging army of their location.\nWe can put such passages to use in another manner, though - to smuggle supplies inside the fort and relieve the starving inhabitants."
 FBIA90: "Exploit them!"
 FBIB90: "Keep the rations"
 FBIT91: "Recruitment Booming"
 FBID91: "Logistics officers recently proposed a new propaganda campaign to drive recruitment. A series of pamphlets have been posted in various cities and villages showing the looming threat of our neighbors, their inherently villainous nature, and the dastardly evils they would perpetrate against our citizens if they ever broke through our defenses and ranks and made it into the countryside. The operation has been wildly successful, and recruitment numbers are way up!"
 FBIA91: "Give our commendations"
 FBIT92: "Contact Network Exposed"
 FBID92: "Having men on the inside is crucial in anticipating the movements and schemes of enemy states. Someones, when a network of informants gets too big, however, the whole thing is blown open and the turncoats are executed.\nIt seems that a certain official was bragging in a tavern last night about the power of our spy networks, and the wrong pair of ears overheard him."
 FBIA92: "Heads will roll!"
 FBIT93: "Logistics Neglected"
 FBID93: "Some people fail to see the importance of well-maintained logistical command, and think wars can be won by strength alone. This unfortunate malady seems to have stricken our own generals, and as such the logistical competence of our state has been compromised."
 FBIA93: "Shameful"
 FBIT94: "Bad Training"
 FBID94: "When you have a standing army or even just vassal levies, having some degree of standardized tactics and planning across the ranks is a logistical necessity. It would seem that some of our training programs are not quite up to snuff, leaving whole portions of the military in a state of decay."
 FBIA94: "Purge the ranks"
 FBIB94: "We must live with it"
 FBIT95: "Enviable Artisans"
 FBID95: "The success of our artisanal class has become an inspiration across the realm. Taverns, shops, and trade posts overflow with high-quality locally-produced goods of every conceivable type, keeping the citizenry entertained and fed. As those old Romans said, all you really need to give the people is 'panem et circenses'."
 FBIA95: "Wonderful!"
 FBIT96: "Manufacturing Profits"
 FBID96: "There is no point to investing in manufacturing if the state doesn't benefit somehow. Our attention to the artisans of the realm has indeed produced dividends for the government's treasury, despite the protests and warnings of some of our more ignorant advisors. How glad we are that they have been proven wrong!"
 FBIA96: "We've got to have money"
 FBIT97: "Prize Pig Discovered"
 FBID97: "Midway on the journey through life a traveller from an antique land was passing through our glorious nation and came upon a farm that boasted a pig so large it dwarfed the local cows. This traveller's story eventually made it to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who sent representatives to investigate the claims. It turned out the traveller's story was true, and the pig and farmer alike were soon escorted to our capital for a public debut.\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is expected to make a speech to kick off the event, but it could potentially go in several directions."
 FBIA97: "Just have a public ceremony"
 FBIB97: "Butcher it for a feast!"
 FBIT98: "Supply Surplus"
 FBID98: "The excellent manufacturing policies of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] have led to a surplus of supplies. Wise advisors have suggested that we invest this surplus into our military, producing better equipped and better fed soldiers than we are usually wont to field. We should redistribute these new supplies immediately, for the glory of our state and people!"
 FBIA98: "Support our troops"
 FBIT99: "Trade Policy"
 FBID99: "The strength of our manufacturing sector and artisans has led to a trade surplus, and ministers have approached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] with proposals to either focus on our grasp of local trade hubs or to try to flood neighboring markets with our cheap goods.\n\nIn which direction should we orient our traders?"
 FBIA99: "Focus internally"
 FBIB99: "Focus externally"
 FBIT100: "New Manufacturing Policy?"
 FBID100: "A certain visiting consultant named Raghnall Ó Ríogáin has suggested we selectively implement a laissez-faire policy with regards to domestic manufacturers and artisans, to test the validity of new economic theories. According to Ríogáin, less regulation will promote growth and competition among local businesses, and the earnings will also trickle up to our coffers."
 FBIA100: "Try it out"
 FBIB100: "Stick with the status quo"
 FBIT101: "Manufacturing Surplus"
 FBID101: "Our focus on manufacturing has paid off! Artisans in cities across the nation have had an exceptional year, from fine wine producers to beer brewers to herders and trappers and tailors and glass-blowers. The ebullience on the ground reaches the top echelons of our court, and even [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is in good spirits."
 FBIA101: "Great news!"
 FBIT102: "Supply Shortage"
 FBID102: "In times of war, one must hope the various cities and forts of the nation are well stocked for the event of a protracted siege.\nIt seems like this was not the case in our current war, as messengers from around the realm report severe supply shortages and a lack of manufactured goods. The populace is weary and many cities could end up surrendering without a fight."
 FBIA102: "This is a disaster"
 FBIT103: "Provinces Ravaged"
 FBID103: "Famine, fire, plague, and various horsemen of the apocalypse have taken their toll on our state's manufacturing sector. Stories circulate of 'ghost towns' that have been abandoned by their entire population due to dangerous surroundings or economic downturn. This problem runs to the root of our nation, and there is little we can do to remedy it."
 FBIA103: "Pray for better times"
 FBIT104: "Decaying Infrastructure"
 FBID104: "While our nation has dedicated a particular focus to manufacturing, we have largely overlooked the upkeep of our existing institutions. As such, many production houses around the fringes of civilization have reached quite a state of disrepair. Mills are rotting and neglected, granaries lay gutted by fire, fields are washed out by rains, and blacksmiths work with obsolete materials.\nTo remedy the situation would take a herculean effort... should we attempt to assuage these woes?"
 FBIA104: "We have to live with this"
 FBIB104: "By any means necessary"
 FBIT105: "The Fate of León"
 FBID105: "Our sibling, [LON.Monarch.GetTitle] [LON.Monarch.GetName] of León, is unable to adequately manage the realm in the face of the Islamic threat. It would much better befit our glorious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to control the Crown of León and to re-unite the lands of Ferdinand the Great. For long we have struggled with [LON.Monarch.GetHerHim] in minor skirmishes and trials by ordeal, but now we have the opportunity to sneak into the capital and arrest [LON.Monarch.GetHerHim], sending all remnants of the old government into exile amongst the Moors. Should we capitalize on this opportunity?"

 FBIT107: "The Battle of Atapuerca"
 FBID107: "In early 1054, while our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was ill and seemed on the verge of death, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] brother in Navarre tried to have [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] murdered and stage a coup in León, just as the crown had originally been taken by the Jiménez dynasty in the first place. However, [Root.Monarch.GetName] managed to escape, and has amassed an army to travel to the borderlands of Navarre to arrest [NAV.Monarch.GetTitle] [NAV.Monarch.GetName] and avenge this ultimate fratricidal insult.\n\nShould we go through with this attack, or listen to the clerics who teach us the virtue of forgiveness and mercy?"
 FBIA107: "Matthew 5:22"
 FBIB107: "Matthew 5:39"
 FBIT108: "Disaster at Atapuerca"
 FBID108: "The actions of the [LON.Monarch.GetTitle] of León's brother, the ruler of our nation in early 1054, have outraged the Leónese aristocracy across the board. In a lapse of judgment [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had launched a botched assassination attempt against the Leónese monarch, and now we have to pay the price as León sends a skirmishing force to our borders in the name of revenge. Reports have just come in that the battle was a disaster for our side; the great general Fortún Sánchez was killed along with our [NAV.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]!\n\nIt seems the virtue of forgiveness was lost on the Leónese, they even cited the Biblical verse Matthew 5:22, which holds that any man in conflict with his brother shall perish in the fires of hell! Would that they could see their own fault."

 FBIA109: "Wonderful"
 FBIT110: "Navarre Resists"
 FBID110: "Despite losing their [NAV.Monarch.GetTitle] in the first battle, the Navarrese nobles continue to resist the righteous demands of our nation, and taunt that if we want to take possessions of the border fortresses we deserve, we will need to launch a full-scale invasion. This may be risky with the powerful Islamic states to our south."
 FBIA110: "Prepare for war!"
 FBIT111: "Tanistry Election"
 FBID111: "Unlike feudal Europe, Ireland organizes its succession around the concept of Tanistry rather than primogeniture. An adult male relative who seems fit for the throne is nominated to succeed the current ruler - this can be his son, but such a relationship is not a necessity. Since our Clan is without an heir, it is now time to honor this ancient tradition and search through our relatives to find someone fit for our glorious throne."

 FBID113: "I had a little sister, whose fair eyes\nWere loadstars of delight, which drew me home\nWhen I might wander forth\n\nIt's past midnight, yet the Palazzo is bathed in light. You've never seen her look like this before. Her eyes dart contagious fire as she approaches you, there's something mad and obscure about her. You consider Eve must have looked of this fashion as she held that fatal fruit to Adam, and you don't notice when she takes the knife from her sleeve. In fact, you don't notice anything wrong at all until you find your arms soaked in blood. You utter one last thing -"

 FBIT114: "Irish Culture"
 FBID114: "Having moved past the petty tribalistic system that defined our society in the past, the people of [Root.GetName] are abandoning their clan-based identity and have begun to see themselves not as [Root.Culture.GetName] but as Irish. One day, maybe we will unite this glorious island under our banner."

 FBID115: "Our friend, the lord of Urbino, who has served [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as an advisor for many years, has brought to our attention an offer from the Sforzas, who have wrestled control of most of the Marche, to marry the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s daughter Costanza and purchase the lordship of Pesaro from us. We will be paid well, but our relatives in Rimini have been eyeing Pesaro for a long time and will be outraged at the sale. As the Pope's greatest enemies, selling to the Sforzas will likely aggravate the Holy Father as well."
 FBIA115: "Sell the lordship!"
 FBIB115: "We're not interested"
 FBIT116: "Outrage in Pesaro"
 FBID116: "My, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have just received word that the [PSO.Monarch.GetTitle] of Pesaro has married his daughter to a Sforza scion and sold the lordship to him! We have been trying to annex Pesaro for years from our relatives, and now all our efforts have been in vain! Given the Pope's hatred of the Sforzas, he may join us in a war to finally drive them out of the Marches. What should we do?"

 FBIB116: "Let it go"
 FBIT117: "Free Cities"
 FBID117: "After passing the Statutum Principum reform, the Holy Roman Empire is open to the declaration of Free Cities, which answer only to the Emperor himself as Immediate States. Old counties and lordships would never consent to such republican governance, but many cities not previously independent have been granted this new privilege across the Empire."

 FBIT118: "The fall of [From.From.GetName]"
 FBID118: "[From.From.GetName] has fallen and [Root.GetName] is now believed to be the new holder of the Russian throne. We are expected to pick up the mantle of the Grand Prince and bring the Russian people into a new era of prosperity and stability.\nIf we want to win over the remaining supporters of [From.From.GetAdjective] rule we must start to build our own Royal bureaucracy and invest in a strong and durable state.

Perhaps the time has come to look back to the [From.GetAdjective] and start the compilation of their history.

 FBIB119: "A thorough work for a solid rule."
 FBIT120: "Abandoning the Pope Altogether?"
 FBID120: "The dawn of the Protestant Reformation has changed the religious landscape of Europe significantly. In a previous century, we decided to abandon the false Popes of Rome and instead follow the true Papal line in Avignon. Now that the rest of Europe is following suit in abandoning their fealty to the Roman Pontiff, and there are so few followers of Avignon left in the world, should we join this new movement that eschews Papal authority altogether?"

 FBIA122: "For the glory of Ruthenia!"
 FBIB122: "For the glory of Russia!"
 FBIT123: "Rota Selection"
 FBID123: "The ancient law codes of the Rus established by Yaroslav the Wise set up provisions for a system of lateral inheritance called the Rota system, after the Russian word for 'family'. In this system, the fourth sibling of the ruling [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would succeed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death rather than [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own child, and in turn each other sibling would move one step up the 'ladder' of most prestigious principalities.\nWith the passing of our last monarch, we must now crown a successor from among our relatives - or ignore this ancient tradition and run the risk of incurring the wrath of our brethren."
 FBIA123: "Let our relative rule!"

 FBIT124: "Rota"
 FBID124: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has nominated our state as [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] successor in the Rota system, wherein instead of primogeniture-based succession, the death of each Grand Prince creates a domino effect of brothers succeeding each other in turns of ruling each Principality. We have no choice but to honor this request by sending [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to occupy the office of [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName].\nOur only option to avoid this fate in the future would be to break all ties with the Grand Principality of the Rus in a state of open defiance and rebellion.\nIn the meantime, we will soon hopefully receive a new ruler of our own from a neighboring state."

There are rumors that the fearsome Norwegian King Harald Sigurdsson hopes to re-establish Viking rule over England based on a promise made to his predecessor, while the Duke of Normandy, whose court protected Eadweard for 25 years, also considers himself the rightful heir. One of the most powerful Earls in our lands is Hereweald, son of Godwin - though it would bring an end to the ancient line of the Cerdicingas, we could embrace him as a son in order to ensure the Anglo-Saxon people have a fighting chance against these barbaric pretenders."

In some cases Kings ruled like near absolute monarchs, actively working against the interests of the nobility, and in other cases Kings ruled as virtual puppets of the [Root.GetGermanicAssembly]'s whims and consulted with it on every important affair. At the very least, it was expected that a legitimate monarch would convene a meeting of the [Root.GetGermanicAssembly] once per year if not more.\nRecently some members of the [Root.GetGermanicAssembly] have proposed that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] rely more on conciliar rule to manage the state, arguing that it will ease the burden of leadership.

 cid_events.1.d: "Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar has been a rising figure in the Castilian court as of late. Already, he has shown his martial prowess in military campaigns across Iberia, most notably against the taifa of Zaragoza. The Moors have already taken to calling him 'al-Sayyid', or the Lord, for his abilities as a commander. Furthermore, his ability to inspire those under his command seems to be unparalleled. This raises the question as to whether we should take him into our service as a leader of the Castilian forces, as doing so would greatly enhance our chance of success in the coming Reconquista against the Moors."

He claims to have journeyed all the way from [From.Capital.GetName] to [Root.Capital.GetName] in search of employment, after being rejected by [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName]. We have heard tales of this man's accomplishments on the battlefield as a renowned commander, and so his offer to lead our army seems promising indeed. Should we accept El Cid into our ranks?"

He claims that both [From.From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.From.GetName] and [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] have both refused his offer to serve them as a commander, resulting in his exile and journey to [Root.Capital.GetName]. Though he was once our enemy, we could put our past animosity behind us and make him leader of our armed forces.

His revolutionary methods and tactics have sent many an enemy fleeing in fear, and inspired just as many to fight under our banner. But he is a precious asset, as his loyalty has shifted between both sides of the raging conflict on the Iberian peninsula in the past.

However, he currently lacks the funds needed for such an expedition. Despite the risks, we could gain a valuable ally if El Cid's campaign is successful.

The faithful have finally awakened to the fact that icons, which have been venerated for centuries, are man-made creations and do not represent the true essence of Divinity."
 vn_iconoclast_events.1.a: "They have finally opened their eyes."
 vn_iconoclast_events.1.b: "The clergy has truly done its part."
 vn_iconoclast_events.2.t: "Iconoclast Art"
 vn_iconoclast_events.2.d: "Since the introduction of iconoclasm, a remarkable artistic movement has developed in our [Root.GovernmentName]. Artists and artisans have begun to explore new ways to express their spiritual beliefs and depict divinity beyond traditional icons. This novel art movement breaks away from conventional representations and gives room for a more experimental interpretation of the faith."
 vn_iconoclast_events.2.a: "It is time for a new court artist."
 vn_iconoclast_events.2.b: "The world shall admire our artworks."
 vn_iconoclast_events.3.t: "Discovery of an Icon Collection"
 vn_iconoclast_events.3.d: "An amazing discovery has been made in a remote monastery of [Root.GetName]. Hundreds of valuable icons and images of saints, accumulated over the centuries, were found hidden in a secret chamber of the monastery. Considering the prohibition of iconoduly, these icons will soon be melted down or sold, and the revenues from them will go to our treasuries."
 vn_iconoclast_events.3.a: "Wonderful."
 vn_iconoclast_events.4.t: "Iconoclast Coinage"
 vn_iconoclast_events.4.d: "The introduction of iconoclastic coins in our country has had unexpectedly positive economic effects. Earlier coins showed illustrations of saints and religious symbols, while our new coins display their denomination or the image of our ruler. Trade is flourishing, prices are stable, and economic growth has increased."
 vn_iconoclast_events.4.a: "Reduce inflation."
 vn_iconoclast_events.4.b: "Promote mercantilism."
 vn_iconoclast_events.5.t: "Absence of Icons"
 vn_iconoclast_events.5.d: "For several years, only a few icons and images of saints have been found. This proves that our policy of removing religious images and combating iconoduly has been successfully implemented. The widespread acceptance of iconoclasm has meant that most citizens no longer have icons in their homes, and the once magnificent iconostases in our churches are empty."
 vn_iconoclast_events.5.a: "This will strengthen our government."
 vn_iconoclast_events.5.b: "Our people are satisfied."

 vn_zoroastrian_events.1.d: "One of our Mobeds has invited [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to attend the Yasna ceremony at the royal Fire Temple. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was put on the spot, however, when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was asked to publicly recite the Ahuna Vairya, one of the most holy prayers in the Zoroastrian faith. The prayer is composed in the long-dead Old Avestan language, and nobody quite knows what it means... but thinking back to childhood, it should be easy to remember.\n\n'Yathâ ahû vairyô athâ ratuš ašâtcît hacâ\nVanghêuš dazdâ mananghô šyaothananam anghêuš mazdâi\nXšathremcâ ahurâi â...'"

 vn_zoroastrian_events.2.d: "With a temple full of onlookers, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] reached the last few words of the prayer and completely confused it with another verse of the Avesta! The Mobeds were visibly disturbed by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] utter lack of knowledge of the most fundamental Zoroastrian ritual, sending waves of shock throughout the room.\n\nThis disastrous display will never be lived down."
 vn_zoroastrian_events.2.dd: "As [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sang out the ancient words of Zarathuštra, tears could be seen in the eyes of the worshippers. The chief Mobed was impressed with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] flawless knowledge of the vowel stresses. If the faith of the royal house was ever in question, any doubts have been dispelled by this display."
 vn_zoroastrian_events.2.a: "An embarrassment!"

 vn_religious_events.153.t: "The Cappadocian Fathers"
 vn_religious_events.153.d: "The trio of so-called 'Cappadocian Fathers', consisting of Saint Basil of Caesarea, Saint Gregory of Nyssa, and Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, is considered to constitute the greatest of early Byzantine theologians. In the fourth century, the three Saints were crucial in developing Orthodox trinitarian doctrines in the face of various anti-trinitarian heresies.\nNow that we have recovered the cities for which each respective Saint served as Bishop, we can restore their tombs and honor their legacies once again."

 vn_women_in_history.1.d: "Born as the eldest child of the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, Anna has lost her status as heir to the throne through the birth of her younger brother Kaloioannes. As the wife of Caesar Nikephoros Bryennios, she was interested in the quadrivium (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy and music), but also studied medicine. On top of that, she wrote a treatise on gout and ran a hospital in Constantinople. Anna simultaneously studied philosophy and was a follower of Christian Aristotelianism, which had neo-Platonic traits. Thus, a remarkable prosperity of Aristotelianism stemmed from a philosophical circle maintained by Anna Komnene, the daughter of the emperor who had so far been excluded from political life.\nIn the present times, however, when we are tumbling from one crisis to the next, it would certainly be worthwhile to allow her to return to imperial politics - either as advisor or even as heiress."
 vn_women_in_history.1.a: "Under her, the Byzantine Empire shall flourish again!"
 vn_women_in_history.1.b: "She is supposed to assist us as a capable advisor at court."
 vn_women_in_history.2.t: "Jeanne d'Arc"
 vn_women_in_history.2.d: "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have received a letter from the local commander of Vaucouleurs announcing a legendary young lady at our court. According to official records, she was named Jeanne at her baptism. But more important than her name are the rumors that are spreading about her. It is said that since the age of 13 she has been receiving visions of Saint Catherine, who told her to free France from its miserable situation. So she left her parental home at the age of 16 and requested an audience in Vaucouleurs, where she proved her immense piety and religiousness. Now she is on her way to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to speak to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself].\nSeveral of our subjects have lost their lives fighting the English, which is why the morale among our knights is low. However, with such a Holy Virgin in our service, who wishes to reconquer our beloved country in the name of Heaven and God, the war could turn in our favour and eventually drive the English entirely back to their island."
 vn_women_in_history.2.a: "Make an armor for her and put a small regiment at her side."
 vn_women_in_history.2.b: "Losing her is too risky. Keep her at court."

 vn_women_in_history.3.t: "Hildegard von Bingen"
 vn_women_in_history.3.d: "Hildegard von Bingen had already spent her life in a monastery as a teenager. After she had received visions, she began to write down these and theological and anthropological ideas in Latin in 1141. Her main work Scivias ('Know the Ways') was written in a period of six years and contains 35 miniatures. These miniatures of theological content are extremely artistically painted in bright colours and serve mainly to illustrate the complicated and profound text.\nPope Eugene III gave her permission to publish her visions in 1147. Thanks to her political importance, she was soon able to found the monastery of Rupertsberg. Her extraordinary reputation helped Hildegard to acquire very extensive monastic estates. This increasing wealth also affects the life of the community and causes criticism. Thus, several clergymen, but also leaders of other communities attack Hildegard because her nuns, contrary to the evangelical advice of poverty, allegedly live luxuriously and only women from noble families are accepted in Rupertsberg. Nevertheless, Hildegard is one of the wisest women of the present, whose knowledge and influence we should exploit for ourselves."

 vn_women_in_history.3.c: "The secluded monastery is the best place for her."
 vn_women_in_history.4.t: "Caterina da Siena"
 vn_women_in_history.4.d: "An interesting figure has recently come to the public eye. A nun gave up the lonely years in the monastery to help the poor and sick or to assist convicted criminals. Her charisma and her work led to the formation of a group around her, for whom Catherine became a spiritual mother. This group includes nuns, acquaintances, friends, Dominicans and staff of the Sienese hospitals. Catherine expresses herself not only on ecclesiastical issues but also in political and social matters, by giving public speeches and - if she felt it necessary precisely because of her attachment to the Church - also by sharp criticism of the ecclesiastical and political leaders.\nShould we support this impressive woman or send her back to the monastery?"
 vn_women_in_history.4.a: "Transfer the leadership of our [Root.GovernmentName] to her."

 vn_women_in_history.5.d: "Sichelgaita di Salerno is the second wife of the Apulian Duke Robert Guiscard. Many times, she accompanies her husband during his conquests in southern Italy, such as during the siege of Trani. In the Battle of Dyrrhachium in 1081, she stood in full armour on the field and gathered her and Robert's troops, when they were first repulsed by the Byzantine army and in danger of losing cohesion. Our enemies refer to her as like another Pallas, if not a second Athena. Which is the best way to make use of this competent woman?"

 vn_women_in_history.8.t: "Eleanor of Aquitaine"
 vn_women_in_history.8.d: "Without an heir for Aquitaine, our possessions will be confiscated by the King of France if our ruler should die now. To avoid this, we could declare the young princess Eleonore as heiress, whose beauty, intelligence and frankness are appreciated by the court officials. We are confident that she could lead Aquitaine as its Duchess to a dominant position within the French Kingdom."

 vn_women_in_history.9.d: "Fatima al-Samarqandi was born in the Uzbek city of Samarkand as the daughter of a Muslim lawyer and scholar when it was under the control of the Mongols. From her father, she learned Islamic jurisprudence, the Quran and hadith at an early age so that she was able to issue fatwas. When Samarqandi became of an age suitable for marriage, many rich and powerful men asked for her hand. It is reported that kings and princes wanted to marry this intelligent and knowledgeable woman. But Samarqandi's father wanted better for her, so she married a scholar from Aleppo. Although her husband is well-educated and knowledgeable, Samarqandi's knowledge and jurisprudential ability surpass his. In fact, her husband often turns to her for advice on fatwas or other matters.\nShall we hire this strong, resilient and intelligent woman?"

 vn_prices.1.t: "Siberian Whaling"
 vn_prices.1.d: "After English and Dutch explorers, in search of a Northeast Passage north of Siberia, came across rich whale populations near Spitsbergen, an extensive and centuries-long hunt for the coveted animals began. The fish oil would later be used as an important raw material for the production of soaps, fats, ointments and leather care products, creating a completely new industry section."

 vn_prices.2.t: "Increasing Demand For Oil Lamps"
 vn_prices.2.d: "Following the invention of lanterns with glass windows, the more and more gendarmes are starting to install oil lamps as street lighting in cities. Portable lanterns make it possible to light even the darkest streets at night, scaring off thieves and robbers. The new innovative oil lamps are also proving advantageous for private use."
 vn_prices.2.a: "Excellent."
 vn_prices.3.t: "The Philosopher's Stone?"
 vn_prices.3.d: "Gold is undoubtedly considered to be one of the most valuable metals of all, which can only be mined or extracted in small quantities in a few places, making it an expression of prestige and wealth. As a result, some alchemists have started to artificially transmute base metals, such as iron and zinc, into gold, putting worthless imitations into circulation."
 vn_prices.3.a: "This will decrease the demand for gold."
 vn_prices.4.t: "Pilgrim Badges"
 vn_prices.4.d: "With the beginning of the Crusades, the tradition of bringing religious effigies home as a testament for a pilgrimage experienced an upswing. While simple pilgrims are content with coins, ampoules or small bells, many of the Crusaders wear necklaces with Christian symbols under their armour as they march to the Holy Land, spurring them on to fight for their faith."
 vn_prices.4.a: "This will increase the demand for tin."
 vn_prices.5.t: "Tin Tableware"
 vn_prices.5.d: "From the increase of the prosperity in the trading cities of Europe, the new pewter dishes came to high reputation. Slowly it displaced wooden tableware from the cities and spread to the countryside. The material is also ideal for other household items like candle holders, making it impossible to imagine living without it."
 vn_prices.5.a: "Tin has become a cheap substitute for other metals."
 vn_prices.6.t: "Caribbean Pearls"
 vn_prices.6.d: "After the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, the Isla de Margarita and Isla de Cubagua were among the first places in the New World to be seized and colonized by the Europeans. The production of pearls from the coastal pearl beds quickly began here, and Caribbean pearls were exported to Europe as a result. Many kings and queens of Europe began to crave these exotic and luxurious objects in order to increase their prestige and wealth."
 vn_prices.6.a: "This will decrease the demand for European pearls."
 vn_prices.7.t: "Monastery Brewery"
 vn_prices.7.d: "During Lent, monks were forced to bow to hard rules that allowed only a few dishes. In order to avoid malnutrition, many monasteries began brewing their own beers, as liquid food was not forbidden. In the newly founded monastery breweries, experimentation with various ingredients started, resulting in dozens of different local beers. The beer was quickly sold to the common people, where it developed into one of the most popular folk drinks."
 vn_prices.7.a: "This will increase the demand for beer."

 vn_prices.8.d: "Expelled from their homeland by the horrors of the Thirty Years' War, many Waldensians fled to Germany, where they looked for tolerant counts and dukes in whose domains they were allowed to settle. There they began to drain swamps and cultivate the land, growing potatoes that had been unknown to the locals until then. Although it would take quite a long time before this tuber developed into an inexpensive staple food, it should not only protect the Germans from starvation and famine several times."
 vn_prices.8.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.9.t: "Summa Lacticiniorum"
 vn_prices.9.d: "Cheese production in Europe has a long tradition, which is why today hundreds of local cheese dairies compete for the best of all cheeses. Pantaleone da Confienza, an expert in dairy products from Savoy, has therefore written an extensive book called 'Summa lacticiniorum', in which he demonstrates his knowledge of regional cheeses and cheese production."

 vn_prices.10.t: "Knight Horse Breeding"

 vn_prices.11.t: "Siemens-Martin Process"
 vn_prices.11.d: "With the invention of the Open Hearth Furnace, that was able to maintain constant temperatures above the melting temperature of steel thanks to its special design, significant progress was made in steel production. Although it was possible to process scrap into steel, the steel produced with it was known for its above-average quality, as nitrogen could be prevented from dissolving in the steel."
 vn_prices.11.a: "Excellent."
 vn_prices.12.t: "Syphilis Outbreak"
 vn_prices.12.d: "On their journey back home, Portuguese and Spanish explorers brought not only exotic goods but also diseases from the natives of the New World to Europe, which developed into a severe Syphilis epidemic in the 16th century.

 vn_prices.13.t: "Afterpains of the Black Death"
 vn_prices.13.d: "The Black Death is raging in Europe and ravaging millions of people, whether peasants or nobles. Many regions are left behind depopulated, leaving fields uncultivated. As a result, food production is suffering, leading to famine and even more poor people dying."
 vn_prices.13.a: "Terrible times!"
 vn_prices.14.t: "Arab Agricultural Revolution"
 vn_prices.14.d: "Agriculture in the Near East has always proved difficult due to a lack of freshwater, which confronts farmers with new challenges time and again.

 vn_prices.14.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.15.t: "Renaissance Architecture"
 vn_prices.15.d: "With the start of the Renaissance, the decline of medieval architecture began, leading to the emergence of new, modern styles. Inspired by the constructions of the Romans and Greeks, the newly erected churches and palaces were increasingly covered or decorated with marble. Many cities in Italy and Greece became wealthy and respected through the mining of marble."

 vn_prices.16.t: "Dried Fruits"
 vn_prices.16.d: "In Mesopotamia, the conservation of fruit by drying has been practiced since thousands of years, where it was considered a vitamin-rich and healthy diet. Only after the expansion of the Ottoman Empire to Southeast Europe did dried fruit spread through Anatolia and Greece to Western Europe, where people slowly began to dry fruits such as grapes or figs themselves."
 vn_prices.16.a: "This will increase the demand for fruits."
 vn_prices.17.t: "Invention Of Spectacles"
 vn_prices.17.d: "The invention of spectacles by an Italian monk in the late 13th century revolutionized work in monastic scriptoria. With the help of convex lenses, far-sighted monks were able to detect and read even the smallest letters, helping them to write and copy theological writings."

 vn_prices.18.t: "Gingerbread Bakeries"

 vn_prices.19.t: "European Carpet Weaving"
 vn_prices.19.d: "With the improvement of handmade textile manufacturing, many carpet weavers began to open in large French, English and Dutch cities. In terms of technique and style, they were inspired by oriental carpets, which had enjoyed great prestige until then thanks to their immaculate quality. For this reason, it was no longer necessary to rely on expensive imports from Persia or North Africa, but instead to buy local carpets that resembled the original ones."
 vn_prices.19.a: "This will decrease the demand for carpets."
 vn_prices.20.t: "Irish Whiskey"
 vn_prices.20.d: "The English knight Sir Thomas Phillips was granted the royal right to distill whiskey in 1608, which led to the founding of Ireland's first distillery.

 vn_prices.20.a: "This will increase the demand for spirits."
 vn_prices.21.t: "Fishery Breakthroughs"

Only through later advancements of the construction, proper fishing fleets were created, consisting of hundreds of fishing boats. These were able to endure for weeks on the high seas, often the caught fish were transferred to trading ships, which returned to the coast, while the fishing boats continued fishing. Thus, with only three or four such voyages at sea per year, enough fish could be harvested to cover any demand for fish."

 vn_prices.22.t: "Spirits cure the Black Death?"
 vn_prices.22.d: "Millions of people are infected with the Black Death and plague doctors are desperately trying to fight the disease. Without a universal remedy, they often have only the use of dubious healing methods, often influenced by superstition.

 vn_prices.23.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.24.t: "Widespread Deforestation"
 vn_prices.24.d: "Forests were an important habitat in the Middle Ages, not only because they provided wood and food, but also because many other economic sectors depended on them. Due to the increasing population, extensive deforestation often took place in order to create new areas for settlement and grazing. As a result, forests were uncontrollably overexploited, leading in many places to a shortage of timber or firewood, followed by much too late regulations by feudal lords."
 vn_prices.24.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.25.t: "Intensification of Sahara Trade"
 vn_prices.25.d: "With the foundation of the Kingdom of Mali, a period of peace and prosperity began in the sub-Saharan Empire. The sale of gold and salt to the Maghreb states led to a gigantic economic boom in both regions, opening up additional trade routes through the Sahara Desert."

 vn_prices.26.t: "Finer Soap Manufactories"
 vn_prices.26.d: "With the end of the Black Death in Europe, people began to believe that bathing alone could prevent diseases, so that in many places public bathhouses were opened, which usually caused the opposite of what had been expected due to a lack of hygiene standards however. Nevertheless, soap developed into a cheap hygienic article, which was produced since the 15th century in manufactories using vegetable oils, occasionally supplying entire kingdoms."
 vn_prices.26.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.27.t: "Smoked Meat"
 vn_prices.27.d: "Crop failures, famines and harsh winters often made it difficult for the common people to survive in the Middle Ages.

 vn_prices.27.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.28.t: "Spread of Rice"
 vn_prices.28.d: "Rice was brought by the Moors to Iberia and Sicily, which has been an unknown food for the Christian world for centuries.

 vn_prices.29.t: "Tobacco Smoking"

 vn_prices.30.t: "Colossuses Of Steel"
 vn_prices.30.d: "For centuries, wood was used to build boats and ships, but with industrialization spreading, shipbuilding also changed. Ships made of wood were not resistant to the new explosive weapons such as paixhans guns, allowing them to be sunk with very little bombardment. Therefore, the construction of more robust iron and later steel ships began, which were initially driven by sails, but later reached tremendous speeds thanks to steam engines."
 vn_prices.30.a: "Ok."
