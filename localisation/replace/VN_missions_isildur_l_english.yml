 vn_bur_inheritance_of_flanders_title: "Inheritance of Flanders"
 vn_bur_inheritance_of_flanders_desc: "Flanders is a prosperous state on the North Sea and the envy of many enterprising states. If we cannot seize it by force, maybe we can seize it by more diplomatic means."

 vn_ase_assimilate_danes_desc: "The Danelaw is a vast region encompassing the entire north of England and much of the Midlands. Forged by the Viking invasions and the subsequent settlement of Scandinavians, it has developed a culture and laws very different from our own. Although we tried to aggressively purge the Danes from the country in the past, this has not ended well for us; we should instead peacefully assimilate those in the Danelaw and progressively erode the legal and cultural differences between north and south."

 vn_ase_elect_new_king_desc: "The Anglo-Saxon succession is elective rather than strictly hereditary; this gives the Witenagemot power to elect the next king upon the incumbent's death. While Edward the Confessor did have a closer living relative, Edgar Aetheling, he was a mere child and so Edward's brother-in-law, Harold Godwinson, became the primary candidate instead.

 vn_ase_beyond_offas_dyke_desc: "Offa's Dyke is a centuries-old fortification built across almost the entire length of the Welsh border by the Mercian king Offa. While this has aided in our defense against the Welsh raiding across the border every now and then, we could eliminate that threat completely if we expand beyond the Dyke."

 vn_ase_anglo_saxon_fleet_title: "Anglo-Saxon Fleet"
 vn_ase_anglo_saxon_fleet_desc: "In the past, our fleet has been woefully inadequate compared to those of the Vikings or even the mainland Europeans. By taking advantage of our long coastline and many harbors, we can construct a new naval fleet to repulse any invasion."

 vn_fri_land_of_monasteries_title: "Land of Monasteries"
 vn_fri_land_of_monasteries_desc: "Frisians are known as devout followers of Christ's rule.

 vn_fri_legacy_of_menno_simons_title: "Legacy of Menno Simons"
 vn_fri_legacy_of_menno_simons_desc: "The Reformation didn't go by unnoticed in Frisia. Our lands gave rise to Protestant reformers such as Menno Simons and Obbe Philips. Since then, Frisia largely abandoned Catholicism and instead embraced various Protestant denominations such as Anabaptism, Calvinism and Lutheranism. Both West Frisia and East Frisia are viewed as societies with a high degree of religious tolerance. We should uphold this ideal of religious tolerance."
 vn_fri_revalue_lex_frisionum_title: "Revalue Lex Frisionum"

 vn_fri_keuren_landrechten_desc: "The 17 Keuren and 24 Landrechten are a collection of texts in which parts of the law and freedoms of Frisia are recorded. The rationale for the written recording of the 17 Keuren and 24 Landrechten lies in the need to make the Frisian privileges known widely, when the royal officials, the counts, are beginning to act as sovereign landlords, thereby threatening our rights."
 vn_fri_upstalsboom_league_title: "Upstalsboom League"
 vn_fri_upstalsboom_league_desc: "Although our lands have long been characterized by the ideals of the Frisian Freedom, this freedom is increasingly being threatened by foreign princes and domestic feuds. In order to provide a more systematic legal system, local leaders should agree and apply rules to all of Frisia. Delegations from all gaue should be sent to annual meetings at the Upstalsboom in Aurich, to judge, to make decisions and, if necessary, to defend our blood-fought autonomy. The delegates should be elected in their home gau at Easter. The meetings can then take place on the Tuesday after Pentecost."
 vn_fri_drenther_crusade_title: "Drenther Crusade"
 vn_fri_drenther_crusade_desc: "The Bishop of Utrecht has trouble maintaining his sovereignty over the peasants of Drenthe. To make matters worse, the Drenthers have chosen the path of heresy with occult religious practices.

 vn_fri_redbads_legacy_title: "Redbad's Legacy"
 vn_fri_redbads_legacy_desc: "Redbad was the king of Frisia from 680 until his death in 719. He managed to defeat Charles Martel at Cologne, and he is considered to be the greatest king Frisia has ever had, ruling over a kingdom that stretched from the Zwin to the river Weser. We are the proud descendants of this once legendary king. We should restore his legacy and reestablish Frisia as a great power again, respected in the whole of Europe and beyond."
 vn_fri_confirm_karelsprivilege_title: "Confirm the Karelsprivilege"
 vn_fri_confirm_karelsprivilege_desc: "The Karelsprivilege is a privilege that Charlemagne has bestowed on us in gratitude for the support we gave in the capture of Rome. The privilege is the basis of the Frisian Freedom. We are not ruled by a foreign count or duke, but we rule ourselves. We should remind the Holy Roman Emperor of this privilege."

 vn_fri_unify_middle_frisia_desc: "Known as Middle Frisia, the area between the Vlie and the river Ems, from Westergo to Oldambt, used to be the political centre of the medieval Frisian realm. We should unite the Frisians living in this part of Frisia."

 vn_fri_frisian_freedom_desc: "All of Frisia, from the Vlie to the Weser, must be united to prevent any foreign prince claiming any of the Frisian lands as his own, threatening the freedoms our people have long enjoyed and continue to enjoy.

 vn_fri_subjugate_groningen_title: "Subjugate Groningen"
 vn_fri_subjugate_groningen_desc: "Originally a small Saxon village, the city of Groningen has become an important trade centre in the last few centuries. Although legally under the authority of the Bishop of Utrecht, the city defied his rule and started acting like a free imperial city, although not formally recognized by the Emperor. Groningen has now turned its eyes on our lands, greatly increasing their influence in the Ommelanden, presenting itself as a Frisian city and as a defender of the Frisian Freedom! If they want to be a Frisian city so badly, we should formally integrate them in our nation."
 vn_fri_reclaim_west_frisia_title: "Reclaim West Frisia"
 vn_fri_reclaim_west_frisia_desc: "The county of Holland used to be called West Frisia, a reminder that these lands once belonged to the Frisian realm. The abandonment of their Frisian roots was completed by adopting the language of Low Franconian. Only in the north, Westflinge, Frisians hold on to their language, leading to countless attempts to subdue them to the rule of the count. Since then the counts of Holland have been a threat to our sovereignty. It is time to remind them of their roots and call these lands West Frisia again!"
 vn_fri_reconquer_trecht_title: "Reconquer Trecht"
 vn_fri_reconquer_trecht_desc: "The center of power of the early medieval Frisian kingdom was the city of Trecht, later renamed to Utrecht. Trecht was founded by the Romans as Traiectum. Later, Trecht became a matter of dispute between the Franks and the Frisians. Trecht is strategically located, giving control of important trade routes on the Rhine to the North Sea. Nowadays, Utrecht is the seat of the Bishop of Utrecht. It is time to once again claim our natural capital and restore Utrecht to its former glory."
 vn_fri_unify_east_frisia_title: "Unify East Frisia"
 vn_fri_unify_east_frisia_desc: "Between the rivers Ems and Weser lie the lands of the East Frisians, known for, among other things, hosting the annual Upstalsboom gatherings. Our people even colonized a strip of land on the other side of the Weser, known as Wursten. We should unite the Frisians living in this part of Frisia."
 vn_fri_develop_emden_title: "Develop Emden"
 vn_fri_develop_emden_desc: "Emden was founded in around 800 as a small trading settlement on a mound on the Ems, connecting it to upstream towns and cities. Emden has great potential to become an important port, connecting Frisia to the trade routes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, enabling our merchants and skippers to once again play an important role in international trade."
 vn_fri_develop_wetlands_title: "Develop the Wetlands"
 vn_fri_develop_wetlands_desc: "The North Sea has been our greatest friend and our most feared enemy at the same time. Although she gave us easy access to foreign markets, the sea has flooded our lands countless times, resulting in the drowning of tens of thousands of people and catastrophic material damage. We should build dykes to protect the coastal areas, giving us a chance to increase agricultural production in the many fertile coastal lands Frisia offers."
 vn_fri_liberate_north_frisia_title: "Liberate North Frisia"
 vn_fri_liberate_north_frisia_desc: "Centuries ago, Frisians settled on Helgoland and the islands of the Uthlande. More recently, the coastal marshlands of the mainland were also colonized. By establishing trade relations with East Anglia and controlling the salt trade, the North Frisians grew prosperous. Nowadays however, Danish kings try to claim sovereignty over the North Frisians. We should come to the aid of our brothers in the North and reunite them with the rest of Frisia. No Frisian should be subjected to foreign rule!"
 vn_fri_north_sea_whaling_title: "North Sea Whaling"
 vn_fri_north_sea_whaling_desc: "With the onset of whaling, the people from the Uthlande in North Frisia have developed a reputation of being very skilled mariners, and most Dutch and English whaling ships bound for Greenland and Svalbard have a crew of North Frisian islanders. On the island of Feer alone, roughly a quarter of the inhabitants are whalers. North Frisian seamen continue to serve foreign whaling companies. Maybe we should set up a whaling company as well so that they can serve Frisian interests."
 vn_fri_rebuild_dorestad_title: "Rebuild Dorestad"
 vn_fri_rebuild_dorestad_desc: "Dorestad was an early medieval emporium in the early medieval kingdom of Frisia. It flourished during the 8th to early 9th centuries as one of the most important trading posts in Northwestern Europe, due to its proximity to the fork in the Rhine, with easy access to all surrounding areas. Persistent Viking raids and the decline of international trade in favor of regional trade led to the downfall of Dorestad as an important trading hub. With Dorestad once again in Frisian hands and with the growing importance of international trade we should restore this town to its former glory."
 vn_fri_found_rustringen_title: "Found Rüstringen"
 vn_fri_found_rustringen_desc: "Lying at the mouth of the river Weser, the gau of Rüstringen is often subject to devastating floods, resulting in the creation of the Jadebusen. We should organize the construction of dikes, paving the way for the foundation of the city of Rüstringen. This will give us an opportunity to control the trade with the upstream city of Bremen and it will also strengthen our position as a naval power."

 vn_fri_mare_frisicum.tt: "No country in the §YNorth Germany§!, §YScandinavia§!, §YLowlands§! or §YBritain§! Superregion has a navy larger than ours."
 vn_fri_mare_frisicum_desc: "The North Sea was once called 'Mare Frisicum'. This name reminds us of the Early Middle Ages, a period which was marked by the rule of, among others, the legendary king Redbad, and in which Frisian merchants maintained and ruled an extensive network of important Northern European trade routes. These trade routes even went as far as Sigtuna and Novgorod. We should do everything we can to restore our position as a maritime power and reestablish Mare Frisicum."
 vn_fri_colonize_peatlands_title: "Colonize the Peatlands"
 vn_fri_colonize_peatlands_desc: "The peatlands have long remained inhospitable areas, leaving them mostly uninhabited until now. Recent technological improvements, however, have enabled us to settle in these lands. The peatlands have a valuable thing to offer: peat, a great source of fuel and a valued product in the ever growing cities of Frisia. We should set up colonies where workers can excavate the peatlands for peat production."

 vn_missions.67.t: "Arthurian Connection Discovered!"
 vn_missions.67.d: "With our promotion of the Arthurian legend as being a distinct part of Cornish identity, this has naturally given us many opportunities to dig deep into the ancestral heritages of the monarchs who share an island with us to find any connections to the legendary king himself. We made a surprising discovery when, as it turns out, a living member of the [arthur_claim.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty of [arthur_claim.GetName] claims to be directly descended from him... or so it would seem. The matter of whether or not this is factually true is irrelevant; as it stands, we have more than enough leverage to claim [arthur_claim.GetName]'s throne as ours, as he recognises us as the legitimate rulers and has offered to support us in seizing it."

#BURGUNDY
 vn_missions.52.t: "A New Capital?"
 vn_missions.52.d: "The city of Arles was once one of the most important cities in southern France, being the seat of the kings of Arles, a kingdom created out of a merger of the former kingdoms of Lower and Upper Burgundy in 933. However, after the death of the nominal king of Arles, Rodolph III, in 1032 without issue, the kingdom passed to the Holy Roman Emperors, and it thus ceased to play a major political role. Several duchies broke away from the kingdom, such as Provence, Dauphine and even our own duchy in Burgundy. This has led to the rapid decline in power and prestige of the city.\nHowever, with Cisjurania, Transjurania, Provence and Burgundy now under our firm control, we can once again claim to be the rightful successors of the this historic kingdom. To celebrate the reunification of these territories, we should move the capital to its rightful place."

And who else should be suited for this task of crowning our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] other than the Holy Roman Emperor? The event has sent shockwaves throughout Europe and will irrevocably alter the balance of power, now that a king with territory stretching from Amsterdam to Arles has been officially recognized by an emperor. We must waste no time in reaping the prestige and foreign praise this coronation has given us!"

Being threatened on all sides by enemies, the Byzantines have utilized elite units such as the Varangian Guard, who are fiercely loyal to the [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle]. Our mercenaries have sworn loyalty to the [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle] and to protect the Empire from external forces, and in return we have been granted a lavish sum of money."

 vn_missions.55.d: "Tensions are brewing as the Norman [NRM.Monarch.GetTitle] [NRM.Monarch.GetName] has made clear his intention to seize the English throne by force if necessary, claiming that the late king Eadweard promised him the throne. Now, he is reaching out to other reputable dukedoms across the land requesting soldiers to fight the inevitable war to come.\nToday, a Norman diplomat arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] asking for our contribution. They claim their cause has even been sanctioned by the Pope himself, but we have yet to respond. How should we proceed, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"

 vn_missions.58.t: "The Education Act of [GetYear]"
 vn_missions.58.d: "The Education Act, passed by the Scottish parliament in 1496, required all landowners to send their eldest sons to school from the ages of 8 or 9 to study Latin, arts and the law. This made Scotland the first country in Europe to institute compulsory education, and would lay the groundwork for more legislation aimed towards improving the quality of education."
 vn_missions.58.a: "Great!"
 vn_missions.60.t: "Founding of the National Kirk"
 vn_missions.60.d: "The Scottish Reformation, beginning in 1560, was the process by which Scotland broke from the Catholic Church and established a new Church of its own, the Kirk, which was heavily influenced by Calvinism and Presbyterianism. By the establishment of this new Church we will be able to unify the country under a single religion and end the ongoing religious turmoil."
 vn_missions.60.a: "Found the Kirk!"

#BARCELONA
 vn_missions.62.t: "Frankish Influence Wanes"
 vn_missions.62.d: "Frankish influence beyond the Pyrenees first began with the creation of the Marca Hispanica in 795 as a defensive buffer zone against the Umayyad Caliphate, which held on to most of Iberia. In 801, the County of Barcelona was acquired and made subordinate to the Marca Hispanica, though after the death of Charlemagne the Catalan states became progressively more independent from Frankish affairs.\nA turning point in the County's history came in 985, when Muslim forces under Almanzor sacked Barcelona. The Count Borrell II sent a request for help to the king of France, Lothar III, but it was refused. Upon the accession of Hugh Capet as king of France, however, Borrell once again sent a request for aid, which was finally answered, but Hugh's nobles refused to support an expedition into Iberia. This almost definitively severed the connection between France and Barcelona.\nEven though we, alongside the other Catalan counties, have been able to act with much greater independence, the fact still remains that we are de jure vassals of the king of France. With the recent build-up of our military, however, we have finally asserted our independence from the Crown for the time being."

Our possession of this invaluable artifact will no doubt strengthen our claims to the Scottish realm and augment our prestige. Meanwhile, we can put the Stone to good use for the coronation of our own kings."

 vn_flavor_ase.2.d: "The exact foundation date of the Abbey is disputed, with some claiming it dates back to the seventh century Bishop Mellitus and others pointing to the tenth century Saint Dunstan. Its beautiful carved corbels, arches, and statuettes are now in disrepair, and the monks often can't even spare candles to light up its lofty interior. Eadweard the Confessor started to fund a renovation project a few years ago in order to have a fitting tomb in which to be buried and to give the abbey the prestige it deserves, but supplies are now running short. The architects request one last lump sum of gold and promise the project will then be completed, adding yet another jewel to the Westminster area."

 vn_missions.64.d2: "As the current Emperor, we in theory possess a great deal of authority across swathes of Central Europe, but the lowly position of our home territory diminishes our legitimacy to rule an empire. Thankfully, we can use our authority to invest ourselves as the Dukes of Milan without the chance of resistance from outside powers."

In order to assert our claim to the rest of the empire he once held, we could relocate to the city.\nHowever, to appeal to our own history we could move the capital to [34.GetName], given that it was the capital of the former Kingdom of Lotharingia.\nAlternatively, the city of [869.GetName], the historical seat of the dukes of Lorraine, could also be a suitable capital.

But they may not be secure enough, as an ambassador has reached the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] court with a request from [From.Monarch.GetName] requesting a union of the states of [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName].

 vn_missions.70.d: "For centuries, Great Moravia has been a distant, long-forgotten ancestor to many West Slavic states. First known to have existed in 833, it was centered around the Morava river which gave the principality its name. Under its rulers Mojmir and Rastislav, the state expanded outwards to reach its maximum extent under Svatopluk 'the Great', which included parts of Moravia, Bohemia, Slovakia and Pannonia, and even as far as Ruthenia.

The Danes, who had joined the Livonian Crusade, met the forces of two Estonian tribes at Lindanise, later known as Reval. During the battle, they were surprised by the Estonians attacking their fortress from five different angles, and looked to be overwhelmed until a red flag with a white cross (the Dannebrog) fell from the sky, giving the Danes renewed hope.
