 culture_group_clockwork_desc:0 "Some fools think that clockwork is for clocks alone. When one witnesses the power of rotating gears ticking away, it's obvious that clockwork can do just about anything one wants it to do: maybe the Creator of the Universe himself wound up existence like a clock and let the gears spin on their own, ticking away the centuries. Be that as it may, Swiss clockmakers are the greatest masters of the art of clockwork in existence, barring God Himself of course."
