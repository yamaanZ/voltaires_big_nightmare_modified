Wir müssen sie für ihre Streitsucht bestrafen und zukünftige Probleme verhindern, indem wir ihren Monarchen absetzen."
 vn_tou_conquer_barcelona_title: "Umzingelt Barcelona"
 vn_tou_conquer_barcelona_desc: "Im Jahr 801 wurde Barcelona von einer fränkischen Armee unter der Führung von Guillaume de Gellone, Graf von Toulouse, erobert. Karl der Große gründete daraufhin eine katalanische Mark, um die Grenzen gegen die Mauren in Andalusien zu verteidigen und schuf so einen starken Barrierestaat zwischen dem Umayyaden-Kalifat von Iberien und dem Frankenreich. Wir sollten dieses Erbe wieder aufgreifen und die Kontrolle über die Region um Barcelona erlangen."
 vn_tou_conquer_roussillon_title: "Aussicht auf Katalonien"

 vn_tou_patron_of_troubadours_desc: "Okzitanien ist die Heimat der Troubadoure - Dichter, Komponisten und Sänger von höfischen mittelalterlichen Liedern, insbesondere in okzitanischer Sprache. Wir sollten diese Bewegung fördern, um unsere Nation in der Welt für ihre einzigartige und erhabene Kunst bekannt zu machen."
 vn_tou_aquitaine_rivalry_title: "Aquitanische Diplomatie"
 vn_tou_aquitaine_rivalry_desc: "Nachdem die Karolinger einst als Unterkönige von Aquitanien über Südfrankreich geherrscht hatten, folgten im kapetingischen Frankreich die Grafen von Poitou auf den Titel. Obwohl sie heute nur noch den Rang eines Herzogs genießen, üben sie eine beträchtliche Macht über die Region aus und haben sich so zu unseren natürlichen Rivalen entwickelt. Wir müssen ihnen zeigen, dass wir ihre Macht nicht widerstandslos hinnehmen werden!"

 vn_tou_conquer_rouergue_desc: "Nach dem Tod der Gräfin Berthe von Rouergue im Jahr 1065 stritten Graf Guillaume IV. von Toulouse und sein Bruder Raimond von Saint-Gilles um das Erbe. Die Brüder wandten sich gegeneinander und kämpften 15 Jahre lang, bevor sie sich darauf einigten, dass Guillaume über Toulouse und seine Umgebung herrschen sollte, während Raimund Rouergue bekommen sollte. Wir müssen die beiden Titel unter einem Herrscher vereinen!"

 vn_tou_conquer_bearn_desc: "Die Gascogne ist, wie der Rest Frankreichs, in kleine Lehen zersplittert, aber der Einfluss des französischen Königs auf die lokalen Grafen und Herren ist praktisch nicht vorhanden. Dadurch ist die Region eine leichte Beute für die Herzöge von Aquitanien oder die Könige von Navarra, was unsere Position ernsthaft gefährdet. Wir müssen ihnen zuvorkommen und unsere Westgrenze an den Golf von Biskaya verlegen, damit uns unsere Feinde nicht irgendwann im Nacken sitzen."
 vn_tou_elevation_to_principality_title: "Principat Mondin"
 vn_tou_elevation_to_principality_desc: "Als Ludwig V. Karling im Jahr 987 starb und die Kapetinger durch Hugo Capet den französischen Thron bestiegen, weigerten sich die Grafen von Toulouse, das neue Herrscherhaus anzuerkennen. Aufgrund ihrer Schwäche sind die Kapetingerkönige bis heute nicht in der Lage, etwas dagegen zu unternehmen, was Toulouse faktisch zu einem souveränen Lehen macht. Diese Tatsache müssen wir ausnutzen, indem wir die Oberhoheit über alle anderen Fürsten des Languedoc und der Gascogne beanspruchen, um unseren politischen Status zu untermauern!"
 vn_tou_conquer_bordeaux_title: "Vorstoß nach Bordeaux"
 vn_tou_conquer_bordeaux_desc: "Es ist an der Zeit, sich unseren schlimmsten Feinden zuzuwenden, den Herzögen von Aquitanien und Grafen von Poitou.

 vn_tou_conquer_provence_title: "Beansprucht die Provence"
 vn_tou_conquer_provence_desc: "Sowohl die Grafen von Toulouse als auch die Grafen von Barcelona erhoben im frühen 12. Jahrhundert Anspruch auf das Herzogtum der Provence. Der Konflikt darüber, welcher der beiden Grafen der wahre Erbe der Provence war, wurde durch die Teilung der Provence in zwei Teile gelöst. Wir müssen die Grafen von Barcelona nun verdrängen und die Provence ganz für uns vereinnahmen."
 vn_tou_aragonese_rivalry_title: "Kontakte mit Spanien"
 vn_tou_aragonese_rivalry_desc: "Herzöge und Könige aus Iberien sind oft an Bündnissen und Ehen mit französischen Fürsten interessiert, mischen sich aber dadurch zu oft in unsere eigenen Angelegenheiten ein. Vielleicht müssen wir unsere Beziehungen zu Spanien neu überdenken."

 vn_tou_weather_catharism_desc: "Die Katharer - oder Albigenser, benannt nach der Stadt Albi - gehören zu einer asketischen Strömung innerhalb des Katholizismus und nennen sich selbst "Gute Christen" - "Perfecti". Da sie die katholische Lehre in ihren Grundfesten ablehnen, werden wir uns auf religiöse Konflikte einstellen müssen."

 vn_tou_conquer_limoges_title: "Erobert das Limousin"
 vn_tou_conquer_limoges_desc: "Die Vizegrafschaft Limoges wird von einem Nebenzweig der Raimondinger regiert, was uns berechtigte Ansprüche auf die Herrschaften des Limousin einräumt. Wir sollten sie geltend machen, bevor der Herzog von Aquitanien oder der französische König die Region wieder unter ihre Fittiche nehmen können."
 vn_tou_secure_religious_peace_title: "Sichert Reli-\ngionsfrieden"
 vn_tou_secure_religious_peace_desc: "In den Augen der katholischen Kirche gilt die katharische Bewegung als Häresie; ihre theologischen Positionen werden als absurd, wenn nicht gar als teuflische Frevel angesehen. Daher wurden die Katharer auf dem Dritten Laterankonzil im Jahr 1179 von Papst Alexander III. zum ersten Mal verurteilt und exkommuniziert, was die Unterdrückung der Katharer durch die katholische Inquisition zur Folge hatte. Als eine Nation, die direkt vom Katharertum beeinflusst wurde, müssen wir ein für alle Mal entscheiden, ob wir den katholischen Willen annehmen oder die katharische Kirche mit unserem Leben verteidigen."

 vn_tou_crusading_army_title: "Ritterorden-\nAusbildung"
 vn_tou_crusading_army_desc: "Es kann nie schaden, gut zur Kirche zu stehen, denn sie wird nicht nur unsere Herrschaft legitimieren und uns in Zeiten der Not unterstützen, sondern ihre Ritterorden werden im Bedarfsfall sogar für uns kämpfen. Also lasst uns einige Ritter rekrutieren und ausbilden, um sie im Notfall gegen unsere Feinde einsetzen zu können."

 vn_tou_seize_tripoli_desc: "Jerusalem, heilige Stätte des Christentums, steht schon zu lange unter der Herrschaft ungläubiger Herrscher. Es ist an der Zeit, das Kreuz in die Hand zu nehmen und die alte christliche Herrschaft im Gelobten Land wiederherzustellen, um Gott und der Christenheit den Ruhm zu bringen, den sie verdienen."
 vn_tou_occitan_kingdom_title: "Unser eigenes Königreich"
 vn_tou_occitan_kingdom_desc: "Ab 418 war das berühmte Westgotenreich auch als Königreich von Toulouse bekannt, da die westgotischen Könige Toulouse als ihre Hauptstadt nutzten, von wo aus sie die Unterwerfung von Hispania befehligten. Erst als eine Koalition aus Franken und Burgundern König Alarich II. 507 in der Schlacht am Campus Vogladensis besiegte und Toulouse plünderte, begann die westgotische Macht in Gallien zu zerfallen. Wir müssen uns an den Franzosen rächen und die Idee eines alten okzitanischen Königreichs wiederbeleben!"
 vn_tou_ports_of_languedoc_title: "Los Pòrts dau Leon"
 vn_tou_ports_of_languedoc_desc: "Der Golf von Lyon bildet den einzigen Mittelmeerzugang für Frankreich und durch unsere Nähe zur Küste könnten wir mit Leichtigkeit in das Mittelmeergeschäft einsteigen. Dafür fehlen uns aber arbeitsame Häfen und mächtige Flotten, daher sollten wir dieses Thema zügig angehen."
 vn_tou_conquer_perigord_title: "Beansprucht das Périgord"
 vn_tou_conquer_perigord_desc: "Im 10. Jahrhundert verloren die Herzöge von Aquitanien die Kontrolle über die Grafschaft La Marche. Wir müssen sie selbst unterwerfen, bevor uns ein anderes Lehen zuvorkommt."

Diese verhängnisvolle Periode wurde erst durch die Karolinger im 8. Jahrhundert und die Liudolfinger im 10. Jahrhundert durchbrochen und führte zu einem Aufschwung der europäischen Zivilisationen.

Sollten jedoch die Kurfürsten, die mächtigsten Männer hinter dem Kaiser, ihre Differenzen beiseite legen und sich gegen den Kaiser verbünden, könnte eine katastrophale Kettenreaktion in Gang gesetzt werden, die das Reich von innen heraus zerreißt.

Erfurt oder Weimar, die sich in fremden Händen befinden, sollten ausreichend sein. Wenn wir jedoch unsere Nachbarn nicht verärgern wollen, müssen wir an eine andere Stadt denken, die würdig ist, unsere Hauptstadt zu sein."
 vn_thu_starrsinn_title: "Thüringer Starrsinn"
 vn_thu_starrsinn_desc: "Wenn die Nachbarn um uns herum nur nach einem Zeichen der Schwäche Ausschau halten, müssen wir in der Lage sein, uns zu verteidigen. Unser verstorbener Monarch, Ludwig der Springer, hat das vor uns allen erkannt: Er hat die Wartburg in Eisenach gebaut. Wenn wir uns verteidigen wollen, sollten wir in seine Fußstapfen treten."
 vn_thu_religious_overthrow_title: "Religiöser Umsturz"
 vn_thu_religious_overthrow_desc: "Eine der berühmtesten Persönlichkeiten, die aus Thüringen stammten, war der Augustinermönch Martin Luther. Wird er als Ketzer betrachtet werden, der auf dem Scheiterhaufen verbrannt werden soll, oder sind seine Lehren der einzig wahre Glaube?"
 vn_thu_third_university_title: "Tertius Univer-\nsitas Imperii"
 vn_thu_third_university_desc: "Im Jahr 1394 wurde in Erfurt die dritte Universität auf kaiserlichem Boden gegründet. Damit stellen wir Thüringer die Wissenschaft über alles andere. Unser Erbe soll Weisheit und Bildung sein."
 vn_thu_kulturstadt_weimar_title: "Kulturstadt Weimar"
 vn_thu_kulturstadt_weimar_desc: "Während Städte wie Prag oder Wien die kaiserliche Autorität symbolisieren und das Herz des Reiches sind, kann keine dieser Städte den Titel "kulturelles Herz Deutschlands" für sich beanspruchen. Mit großen Köpfen wie Goethe und Schiller, die Weimar zu einem unbestrittenen Zentrum der Literatur und Kultur machten, ist es kein Wunder, dass die klassische Ära in Deutschland oft als "Weimarer Klassik" bezeichnet wird. Weimar steht im kulturellen Kernland der Literatur und Wissenschaft und unser Ruf auf den Schultern von Giganten wie Goethe und Schiller."

#Taifa RELs
 vn_missions.1.t: "Wiederherstellung des Kalifats von Córdoba"
 vn_missions.1.d: "Im Jahr 929 wurde das Kalifat von Córdoba von der Dynastie der Umayyaden errichtet, nachdem diese vom Kalifat der Abbasiden im Osten gestürzt worden war. Die umayyadischen Kalifen haben daraufhin fast 100 Jahre lang den größten Teil der iberischen Halbinsel regiert, bis sie um die Jahrtausendwende durch interne Machtkämpfe entthront wurden.  Daraufhin begann die andalusische Fitna - der Kampf von Dutzenden von Taifas um die Vorherrschaft auf der Halbinsel.\n\nNun haben wir gesiegt, nachdem wir die anderen Taifas unterworfen und unter einem Banner vereint haben. Wir sind bereit, das alte Kalifat von Córdoba einzufordern, denn wir regieren immer noch im Namen der Umayyaden. Wir stehen nunmehr vor der Frage, wer dieses Kalifat anführen soll."
 vn_missions.1.a: "Die derzeitige Situation ist in Ordnung."
 vn_missions.1.b: "Dankt zugunsten eines umayyadischen Fürstens ab."
 vn_missions.1.c: "Heiratet in die umayyadische Dynastie ein."
 vn_missions.1.dd: "Behaltet unser republikanisches System bei."
 vn_missions.1.e: "Unser Anspruch auf das Kalifat war noch nie so stark wie jetzt."
#Florence
 vn_missions.2.t: "New Stocking of our Libraries"
 vn_missions.2.d: "For centuries, our books collections and libraries have provided our scholars, scientists and advisors with vast amounts of ancient and modern knowledge, driving them to new accomplishments. Thanks to the book printing that is now spread throughout Europe, it is possible for us to reproduce this knowledge with little effort. The possibilities are endless, but we have to decide which books to print first."
 vn_missions.2.a: "Philosophy has always fascinated us"
 vn_missions.2.b: "We can improve our diplomatic skills by learning from Roman statesmen"
 vn_missions.2.c: "Let us look ahead and explore modern warfare"
#Apulia
 vn_missions.3.t: "Sicilians under Foreign Rule"
 vn_missions.3.d: "For decades we have ruled over Italians, but our nobility and clergy largely remained of Norman culture. We are united in faith, but the cultural differences are tremendous, which constantly leads to tensions with the common people. To tackle this problem, we could try to spread our culture among the rural population as well, so that they slowly accept it and give up their own. Alternatively, we could abandon Norman customs and embrace Sicilian culture as primary culture."
 vn_missions.3.a: "Spread Norman culture intensively"
 vn_missions.3.b: "The days we used to call ourselves Norman are over"
#Latin Empire
 vn_missions.4.t: "Demands of the Venetians"
 vn_missions.4.d: "After the successful but costly crusade, our treasuries are strained and the Venetians demand reparations from us, although we have been their allies! We cannot afford to squeeze our scarce funds to greedy Doges, yet our advisors have proposed a solution to this. By stealing and melting down relics from Orthodox churches, we will be able to improve our financial situation and pay the Venetians. This would, however, make the Greeks dislike us even more than they already do."
 vn_missions.4.a: "Melt them down and turn them into money!"
 vn_missions.4.b: "The Venetians shall curb their greed!"
#Morocco
 vn_missions.5.t: "A New Caliphate!"
 vn_missions.5.d: "The destruction of the Fatimid caliphate and the conquest of Cairo by the Moroccan troops has not only stirred up the Muslim world. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] was due to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] recent accomplishments crowned as new Caliph of [Root.Religion.GetName] Islam by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors, thus stepping into the footprints of Prophet Mohammad himself. The ambitious, mighty and faithful Empire of Islam stretching from al-Andalus to Egypt, born of descent from the caliphs of old pledges is to fight for the future of the peoples of Islam as a whole."
 vn_missions.5.a: "Let the infidels tremble!"
#Genoa
 vn_missions.6.t: "The Purchase of Chios"
 vn_missions.6.d: "Thanks to our excellent relations with [2341.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [2341.Owner.Monarch.GetName] [2341.Owner.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] in recent years causing our two nations to prosper, we have received a particularly promising offer: Due to their richness, the Aegean islands are often attacked by pirates, which is why [2341.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [2341.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has proposed the sale of the island of Chios to let us take care of its defence. We will be able to use it as a naval base, which will make it easier to perform own military operations in the future, but also as a trading hub, increasing our trade influence there.\nDo we want to be appointed commander of this island?"
 vn_missions.6.a: "Give them the money they demand"
 vn_missions.6.b: "Cancel the negotiations"
#Nicea/Epirus/Trebizond
 vn_missions.7.t: "The Reconquest of Constantinople"
 vn_missions.7.d: "For centuries, Constantinople, the Queen of all Cities, has been the center of Western culture, science and trade. Temporarily, hundreds of thousands of people lived in the metropolis, protected by the strongest city walls of the known world. It was not until the momentous Fourth Crusade that the city was for the first time expropriated from Greek hands; the Eastern Roman Empire was considered to have perished. However, thanks to our masterful diplomacy and successful campaigns, we were able to recapture the city that had once been regarded as impregnable. Now we have the choice to return to Constantinople and legitimize our rightful claim to the Roman heritage."
 vn_missions.7.a: "It is time for us to revert to Constantinople"
 vn_missions.7.b: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is better suited as a capital for our ambitions"
#Thuringia
 vn_missions.8.t: "Das Schicksal von Martin Luther"
 vn_missions.8.d: "Da katholische Beamte an der Macht oft Korruption und Habgier an den Tag legen, fordern einige eine Änderung der Religionsausübung.\nEiner dieser Menschen ist der Augustinermönch Martin Luther, der mit der Politik des Papstes und der Kardinäle unzufrieden war, die sich auf die Anhäufung von materiellem Reichtum konzentrierten, und der ein Papier mit 95 Thesen über die Verfehlungen des Papstes schrieb. Er verurteilt den Ablasshandel und stellt die Rechtschaffenheit des Papstes in Frage, der zwar behauptet, Vertreter Gottes zu sein, aber ziemlich unheilig handelt.\nDie Hammerschläge Luthers gegen die Wittenberger Kirche, in der seine Werke für jedermann sichtbar aufgehängt waren, hallten durch Europa und schreckten den Papst auf. Komplexe politische Beziehungen machen die Zugehörigkeit zu Luther oder dem Papst nicht nur zu einer Frage der Religion, sondern auch der Macht.\n\nNun kommt diese Frage an unseren königlichen Hof und [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] steht vor der Frage: Entweder wir unterstützen Luther und werden zu einem Leuchtfeuer der Reformation oder wir schicken ihn vor Gericht wegen seiner Gotteslästerung über Kirche und Papst."
 vn_missions.8.a: "Unterstützt Luther."
 vn_missions.8.b: "Er soll für seine Blasphemie vor Gericht gestellt werden."
#Assyria
 vn_missions.9.t: "Religious Uncertainty"
 vn_missions.9.d: "Mesopotamia is considered a place where many different religions and beliefs are confronted with each other. Religious instability made our nation reconsider the path they are on. What faith shall govern our nation from now on?"
 vn_missions.9.a: "Choose the Church of the East."
 vn_missions.9.b: "Return to our ancient roots."
 vn_missions.9.c: "Find a suitable middle ground."
 vn_missions.9.dd: "Bow down to Allah."
 vn_missions.9.e: "Enforce the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith!"
 vn_missions.10.t: "The Church of the East"
 vn_missions.10.d: "After the Church of the East had detached itself from the 'Great Church' in the 4th century due to religious disagreements, it quickly transformed into the patron of the Christians of Mesopotamia. The Sassanid rulers promoted the Church of the East in order to maintain the loyalty of their Christian subjects and to create a contrast with the hostile Byzantium. The power of the Church of the East did not begin to fade even after the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century, when missionaries spread the Nestorian faith to India and even China.\nWith the conquest of Baghdad, the seat of the Patriarch of the Church of the East, the time has come for us to decide its fate. Do we want to promote, restrict or even destroy it?"
 vn_missions.10.a: "The current situation is fine."
 vn_missions.10.b: "Come to an understanding with the Church."
 vn_missions.10.c: "Demand full autonomy."
 vn_missions.10.dd: "Abolish the Church."
 vn_missions.11.t: "Return of the Israelites"
 vn_missions.11.d: "After the Black Death had lied waste to Europe, a lot of Jews were expelled from their homes. In the hope for a better future, many travelled to the home they desired to return to the most, hoping that the current [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] is more tolerant than the Assyrian Empires of the past. However, this is up to us to decide."
 vn_missions.11.a: "Allow them to settle in Judah."
 vn_missions.11.b: "Disperse them all over the [Root.GovernmentName]."
 vn_missions.11.c: "Take their money and tell them to leave."
 vn_missions.11.dd: "Allow them to settle as Dhimmi."
#Byzantium
 vn_missions.12.t: "Regnum Bospori"
 vn_missions.12.d: "Thanks to successful campaigns in recent years, we were able to claim the other side of the Black Sea coast for ourselves. Since this region was already ruled by a Roman client state in Roman times, the question now arises whether we should relinquish the local administration in order to focus our attention on other regions of our Empire."
 vn_missions.12.a: "Appoint a viceroy"
 vn_missions.12.b: "We do not need a client state"
#Valencia / Tortosa / Dania
 vn_missions.13.t: "Der Aufstieg der Saqaliba"
 vn_missions.13.d: "Die so genannten Saqaliba repräsentieren den Teil unserer Mameluken, der von den südslawischen Völkern des Balkans abstammt. Diese Kaste hat in den letzten Jahren viele große Männer hervorgebracht und war maßgeblich an unserem politischen Aufstieg beteiligt und prägt sogar das Leben am Hof in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\nWir stehen nun vor der Frage, ob wir einen kühnen Weg einschlagen und die Herrschaft von [Root.GetName] diesen entschlossenen und ehrgeizigen Männern anvertrauen sollen..."
 vn_missions.13.a: "Sie sollen herrschen."
 vn_missions.13.b: "Diese Schurken sind nicht von edlem Blut!"
 EST_VAL_SAQALIBA_RISE: "Aufstieg der Saqaliba"
 EST_VAL_SAQALIBA_DECLINE: "Niedergang der Saqaliba"
#Sardinia
 vn_missions.14.t: "Regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae"
 vn_missions.14.d: "Im Jahr des Herrn, [GetYear], hat der Papst eine Entscheidung über das Schicksal Sardiniens getroffen. Dank unserer sorgfältigen Führung hat er eine weise Entscheidung getroffen: Das Herzogtum Sardinien soll von seinen Einwohnern und nur von seinen Einwohnern regiert werden und [Root.Monarch.GetName], Herzog von Sardinien und Korsika, soll ihr Herrscher sein."
 vn_missions.14.a: "Ausgezeichnete Nachrichten!"
#Sardinia-Piedmont
 vn_missions.15.t: "Der Kirchenstaat wird aus der Romagna vertrieben!"
 vn_missions.15.d: "Hat der Herr uns im Stich gelassen? Heute, im Jahr $YEAR$, haben die Armeen von [From.GetName], den Verwandten des Teufels, unser rechtmäßiges Territorium in der Romagna überrannt. Auch wenn wir es ohne Zweifel mühelos von diesen Bestien zurückerobern werden, wird dies unser diplomatisches Ansehen stark beeinträchtigen."
 vn_missions.15.a: "Ketzer!"
#Georgia
 vn_missions.16.t: "Die Zukunft der armenischen Kirche"
 vn_missions.16.d: "Die Armenier sind seit jeher Anhänger des miaphysitischen Christentums, das sich im 5. Jahrhundert vom übrigen Christentum abspaltete. Daher stellt sich nun die wichtige Frage, wie wir mit diesen vermeintlichen Häretikern in unseren eroberten Gebieten umgehen werden. Eine Möglichkeit wäre, die armenisch-apostolische Kirche als gleichberechtigte Institution in unserem Staat zu belassen und den Armeniern zu erlauben, ihren Glauben weiterhin zu praktizieren. Alternativ werden wir uns für einen viel radikaleren Weg entscheiden, nämlich die Auflösung der armenischen Kirche, um der [Root.GetAdjective]en Kirche zu ermöglichen, ihre Fühler nach Armenien auszustrecken, was allerdings sicherlich Unruhe unter unseren armenischen Untertanen hervorrufen wird. Mit genügend Fingerspitzengefühl könnten wir stattdessen ein Gleichgewicht herstellen, indem wir langsam damit beginnen, die armenischen kirchlichen Institutionen in unsere eigenen zu integrieren, um so die beiden Kirchen langfristig zu verschmelzen. Wofür entscheiden wir uns, mein[Root.GetMeFemale] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 vn_missions.16.a: "Bewahrt die Unabhängigkeit der armenischen Kirche"
 vn_missions.16.b: "Dehnt den Einfluss der [Root.GetAdjective]en Kirche aus"

Some German-language titles, such as the sermons of German priests, also originated from his office.
