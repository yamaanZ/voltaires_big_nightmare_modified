 elective_monarchy.17.d: "Ruling in [Root.GetName] is not like ruling in other nations. Dictating the nation's goals is difficult without approval from nobles, sometimes impossible. To a foreign monarch, this may seem disappointing and frustrating, but this cornerstone of [Root.GetAdjective] politics is highly valued in its homeland and is, in fact, what [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to thank for coming into power in the first place. Embracing these ideas might make the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seem weak internationally, but would aid in integrating better and gaining supporters in the Nobility."
